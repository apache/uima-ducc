   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

Creative Commons Attribution License v 2.5

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE 
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY 
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS 
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE 
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE 
RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS 
AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology 
or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, 
along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and 
independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. 
A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a 
Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work 
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical 
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, 
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any 
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, 
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be 
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the 
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound 
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a 
moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for 
the purpose of this License.
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under 
the terms of this License.
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under 
the terms of this License.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this 
License who has not previously violated the terms of this License 
with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission 
from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a 
previous violation.
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, 
limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or 
other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner 
under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, 
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable 
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as 
stated below:

to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more 
Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in 
the Collective Works;

to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform 
publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio 
transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;

to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform 
publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio 
transmission Derivative Works.

For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the 
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance 
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public 
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the 
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music 
rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties 
for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and
distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC 
Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other 
jurisdictions).

Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of 
doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the 
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a 
performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for 
the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, 
subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 
of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether 
now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right 
to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise 
the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly 
granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly 
made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly 
digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and 
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, 
this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, 
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. 
You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or 
restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of 
the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You 
must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the 
disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, 
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any 
technological measures that control access or use of the Work in 
a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. 
The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, 
but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work 
itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create 
a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the 
extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as 
required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, 
upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, 
remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), 
as requested.

If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly 
digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, 
You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, 
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of 
the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or 
(ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party 
or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for 
attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by 
other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title 
of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the 
Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be 
associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the 
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the 
case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work 
in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by 
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original 
Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; 
provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective 
Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable 
authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as 
such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR 
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY 
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF 
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, 
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION 
OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR 
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES 
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR 
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically 
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or 
entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You 
under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated 
provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with 
those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any 
termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here 
is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). 
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the 
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at 
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to 
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is 
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this 
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated 
as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a 
Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the 
Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You 
under this License.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative 
Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work 
on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under 
this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under 
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action 
by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to 
the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach 
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed 
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with 
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements 
or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor 
shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any 
communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual 
written agreement of the Licensor and You.
Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty 
whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be 
liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, 
including without limitation any general, special, incidental or 
consequential damages arising in connection to this license. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons 
has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall 
have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the 
Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark 
"Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons 
without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use 
will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage 
guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available 
upon request from time to time.

                +

                  (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective

      3. Distribution Obligations.
          o

            3.1. Availability of Source Code.

            Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available 
            in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form 
            and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms 
            of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every 
            copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute 
            or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such 
            Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such 
            Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or 
            through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
          o

            3.2. Modifications.

            The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are 
            governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You 
            believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or 
            You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this 
            License.
          o

            3.3. Required Notices.

            You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that 
            identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may
            not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices 
            contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing 
            or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or 
            the Initial Developer.
          o

            3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

            You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software 
            in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable 
            version of this License or the recipients rights hereunder. 
            You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, 
            support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more 
            recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only 
            on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial 
            Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely 
            clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or 
            liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby 
            agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor 
            for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such 
            Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or 
            liability terms You offer.
          o

            3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

            You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software 
            under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license 
            of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this 
            License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms 
            of this License and that the license for the Executable form 
            does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients rights in 
            the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. 
            If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under 
            a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any 
            terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, 
            not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree 
            to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for 
            any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such 
            Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
          o

            3.6. Larger Works.

            You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software 
            with other code not governed by the terms of this License 
            and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a 
            case, You must make sure the requirements of this License 
            are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
    *

      4. Versions of the License.
          o

            4.1. New Versions.

            Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may 
            publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time 
            to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version 
            number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than 
            the license steward has the right to modify this License.
          o

            4.2. Effect of New Versions.

            You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make 
            the Covered Software available under the terms of the version 
            of the License under which You originally received the Covered 
            Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the 
            Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or 
            otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the 
            License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software 
            available under the terms of the version of the License 
            under which You originally received the Covered Software. 
            Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or 
            otherwise make the Covered Software available under the 
            terms of any subsequent version of the License published 
            by the license steward.
          o

            4.3. Modified Versions.

            When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new 
            license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified 
            version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any 
            references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the 
            license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear 
            that the license contains terms which differ from this License.
    *

      5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

      COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT 
      WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
      LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, 
      MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE 
      RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. 
      SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE 
      INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY 
      SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN 
      ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED 
      HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
    *

      6. TERMINATION.
          o

            6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate 
            automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to 
            cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. 
            Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond 
            the termination of this License shall survive.
          o

            6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory 
            judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the 
            Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is 
            referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software 
            (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor 
            or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) 
            directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights 
            granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial 
            Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all 
            Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 
            60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically 
            at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 
            day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant 
            Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to 
            a written agreement with Participant.
          o

            6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all 
            end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor 
            hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any 
            distributor) shall survive termination.
    *

      7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
       NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY 
       OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER 
       OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, 
       INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
       LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 
       COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES 
       OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
       OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY 
       FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE 
       EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT 
       ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, 
       SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

      term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer 
      software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). 
      Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 
      (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with 
      only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is 
      in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision 
      that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.
    *

      9. MISCELLANEOUS.

      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. 
      If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision 
      shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This 
      License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a 
      notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable 
      law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law 
      provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the 
      jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in 
      a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible 
      for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys 
      fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts 
      for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation 
      which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the 
      drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible 
      for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the 
      export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute 
      or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
    *

      10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible 
      for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization 
      of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and 
      Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing 
      herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

Common Public License - v 1.0 

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC 
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM 
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

1. DEFINITIONS 
"Contribution" means: 
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation 
distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are 
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a 
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or 
anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include 
additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software 
distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, 
and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. 
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. 
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are 
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when 
combined with the Program. 
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this 
Agreement. 
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, 
including all Contributors. 

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS 
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to 
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, 
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and 
such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under 
Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise 
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and 
object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the 
Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the 
Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be 
covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any 
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is 
licensed hereunder. 

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to 
its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any 
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other 
intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims 
any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on 
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to 
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby 
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights 
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to 
allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to 
acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license 
set forth in this Agreement. 

3. REQUIREMENTS 

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under 
its own license agreement, provided that: 

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and 
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title 
and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability 
and fitness for a particular purpose; 

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for 
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential 
damages, such as lost profits; 

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered 
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such 
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on 
or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 
When the Program is made available in source code form: 

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within 
the Program. 
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, 
if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify 
the originator of the Contribution. 

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with 
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is 
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who 
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner 
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, 
if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such 
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify 
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, 
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and 
other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified 
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial 
Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial 
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims 
or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property 
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) 
promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) 
allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial 
Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The 
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product 
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If 
that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers 
warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are 
such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the 
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other 
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a 
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the 
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 

5. NO WARRANTY 

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON 
AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS 
OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF 
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of 
using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its 
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the 
risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to 
or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of 
operations. 

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY 
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION 
LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN 
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) 
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE 
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

7. GENERAL 

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the 
remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the 
parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent 
necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect 
to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in 
a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such 
Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation 
is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any 
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software 
or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's 
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such 
litigation is filed. 
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to 
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does 
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of 
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, 
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as 
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement 
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue 
and survive. 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in 
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be 
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to 
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to 
time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this 
Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the 
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate 
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing 
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be 
distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was 
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, 
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) 
under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) 
above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property 
of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, 
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under 
this Agreement are reserved. 
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the 
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this 
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year 
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial 
in any resulting litigation.

non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative 
works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of 
such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a 
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, 
use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, 
if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination 
of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, 
such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. 
The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No 
hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions 
set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe 
the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims 
any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of 
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses 
granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual 
property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow 
Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before 
distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its 
Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license 
agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express 
and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied 
warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including 
direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor 
alone and not by any other party; and

licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used 
for software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a 
manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to 
end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate 
the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial 
product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for 
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product 
offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify 
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs 
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a 
third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions 
of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a 
commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or 
Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to 
qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor 
in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate 
with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. 
The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, 
Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor 
then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance 
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this 
section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors 
related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor 
to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS

of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights 
under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance 
with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or 
interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL 
HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, 
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY 
WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, 
EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not 
affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without 
further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent 
necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim 
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other 
software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted 
under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the 
material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period 
of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement 
terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably 
practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by 
Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid

This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of
authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the
following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:

    Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1 

1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:

    * to reproduce the Original Work in copies;
    * to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;
    * to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;
    * to perform the Original Work publicly; and
    * to display the Original Work publicly. 

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent
claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original
Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the
Original Work and Derivative Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form
of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees
to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along
with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves
the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the
Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit
inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to
distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information
repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies
to the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service
marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original
Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this
License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents,
trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly
stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell
embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in
Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks
are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted
to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any
Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) This section intentionally omitted.

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the
copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by
Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of
this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and
patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to
liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to
the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so
this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or
to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do
so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between
Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent
laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising
any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your
acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,
against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent
infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor
resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws
of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application
of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of
this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and
penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. º 101 et seq., the equivalent
laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive
the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any
appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
make it enforceable.

ANTLR License

We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the
public domain. An individual or company may do whatever
they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the
code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of
ANTLR, or its output, into commercial software.

We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,
we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or
incorporate any source code into one of your programs
(commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that
you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this
system and expect to make other tools available as they are
completed.

	Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Application of License.

	The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
	governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
	Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
	distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
	of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
	copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
	distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
	version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
	License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
	an additional document offering the additional rights described in
	Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code.

	Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
	made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
	either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
	Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
	Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
	Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
	months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
	(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
	has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
	ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
	Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

3.3. Description of Modifications.

	You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
	file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
	the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
	the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
	Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
	Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
	Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
	origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.

	(a) Third Party Claims.

	If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
	intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
	granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
	must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
	"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
	sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
	Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
	available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
	modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
	thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
	mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
	received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

	(b) Contributor APIs.

	If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
	interface ("API") and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses
	which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
	also include this information in the LEGAL file.

	(c) Representations.

	Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
	3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications
	are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has
	sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.5. Required Notices.

	You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
	Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
	Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
	location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
	to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
	You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
	Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
	for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
	rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
	charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
	obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
	may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
	Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
	any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
	offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
	Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
	Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
	support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

	You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
	requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
	and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
	the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
	including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
	obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
	in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
	collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
	Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
	Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
	contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
	compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
	Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
	rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
	License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
	license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
	from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
	Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
	Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
	the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
	terms You offer.

3.7. Larger Works.

	You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
	not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
	Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
	requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

	If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
	License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
	statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
	the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
	describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
	must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
	be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
	extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
	sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
	understand it.

5. Application of this License.

	This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
	attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

6.1. New Versions.

	Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") may publish revised and/or new versions
	of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a
	distinguishing version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions.

	Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
	License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
	version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
	of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one
	other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered
	Code created under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works.

	If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
	only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
	governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that
	the phrases "Sun," "Sun Public License," or "SPL" or any confusingly
	similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your
	license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear
	that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
	Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
	Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A
	shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this
	License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

	COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS,
	WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
	WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
	DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
	THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
	IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
	YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
	COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
	OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
	ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

	8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
	automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
	such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
	sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
	survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
	nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
	shall survive.

	8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
	claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
	or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
	You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

	(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
	infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
	Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
	shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
	unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
	agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
	royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
	Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
	the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
	of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
	mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
	is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
	Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
	the 60 day notice period specified above.

	(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
	Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
	any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
	and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
	sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
	Participant.

	8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
	alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
	indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
	by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
	infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
	granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
	into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
	license.

	8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all
	end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
	which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
	prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

	UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
	(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
	DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
	OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
	ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
	CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
	WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
	COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
	INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
	LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
	RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
	PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
	EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
	THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

	The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
	C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software"
	and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are
	used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
	12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
	U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights
	set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

	This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
	matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
	unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
	necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
	California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
	any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
	With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
	or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
	States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
	subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
	District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
	California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
	without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
	expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
	Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
	Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
	shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
	License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

	As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
	responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
	out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
	work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
	responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
	shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

	Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
	"Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
	Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
	Your choice of the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the
	Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

 License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   1. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
   encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
   with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
   works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
   constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
   defined below) for the purposes of this License. 2. "Derivative Work" means a
   work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such
   as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization,
   motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
   condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed,
   or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
   considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
   avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
   recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
   image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of
   this License. 3. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the
   Work under the terms of this License. 4. "Original Author" means the
   individual or entity who created the Work. 5. "Work" means the copyrightable
   work of authorship offered under the terms of this License. 6. "You" means an
   individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not
   previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
   who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights
   under this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

   1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
   Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works; 2.
   to create and reproduce Derivative Works; 3. to distribute copies or
   phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by
   means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
   Collective Works; 4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display
   publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
   transmission Derivative Works. 5.

      For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition: 1.
      Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
      exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
      rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
      performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work. 2.
      Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive
      right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or
      designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord
      You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
      compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act
      (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions). 6. Webcasting Rights and
      Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound
      recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether
      individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),
      royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,
      subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
      Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

   1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
   digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
   include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with
   every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,
   publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
   any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
   recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense
   the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to
   the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,
   publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
   technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
   inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to
   the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
   Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
   this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor
   You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
   reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You
   create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
   extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
   Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. 2. If you distribute, publicly
   display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any
   Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright
   notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
   medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if
   applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if
   supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
   Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
   unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
   information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit
   identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French
   translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
   Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable
   manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
   Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
   comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
   such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLES OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
   upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
   who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this
   License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
   individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
   Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
   Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
   under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
   provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
   License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
   under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
   force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
   Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
   on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
   License. 2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
   Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
   Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
   this License. 3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
   under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
   the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
   parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
   extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 4. No term or
   provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to
   unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to
   be charged with such waiver or consent. 5. This License constitutes the
   entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
   There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
   the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional
   provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may
   not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

   1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
   digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
   include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with
   every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,
   publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
   any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
   recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense
   the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to
   the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,
   publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
   technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
   inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to
   the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
   Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
   this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor
   You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
   reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You
   create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the

   Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. 2. You may distribute,
   publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform a

   (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the
   Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other license specified in
   the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work
   You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
   perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that
   alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
   the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer
   to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
   publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
   Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or use of
   the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.
   The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective
   Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative
   Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. 3. If you
   distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform
   the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact
   all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
   reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
   pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
   Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
   Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
   unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
   information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit
   identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French
   translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
   Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable
   manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
   Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
   comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
   such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK
AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,

JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS

POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
   upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities

   Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
   under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
   provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
   License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
   under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
   force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
   Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
   on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
   License. 2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
   Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
   Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
   this License. 3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
   under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
   the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
   parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
   extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 4. No term or
   provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to
   unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to

License


Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related
Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the
following:

   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
   and translate a Work; 2. moral rights retained by the original author(s)
   and/or performer(s); 3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's
   image or likeness depicted in a Work; 4. rights protecting against unfair
   competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph
   4(a), below; 5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and
   reuse of data in a Work; 6. database rights (such as those arising under
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
   1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
   implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
   directive); and 7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights
   throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
   implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or
unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit
of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs
and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as
contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in
all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable
law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes
(the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial
invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise
any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in
either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
   surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. 2. Affirmer
   offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
   concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including
   without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
   particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other
   defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
   discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law. 3.
   Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that
   may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any
   person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
   disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or
   other rights required for any use of the Work. 4. Affirmer understands and
   acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no
   duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   1. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
   encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
   with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
   works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
   constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
   defined below) for the purposes of this License. 2. "Derivative Work" means a
   work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such
   as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization,
   motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
   condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed,
   or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
   considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
   avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
   recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
   image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of
   this License. 3. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the
   Work under the terms of this License. 4. "Original Author" means the
   individual or entity who created the Work. 5. "Work" means the copyrightable
   work of authorship offered under the terms of this License. 6. "You" means an
   individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not
   previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
   who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights
   under this License despite a previous violation. 7. "License Elements" means
   the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and
   indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

   1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
   Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works; 2.
   to create and reproduce Derivative Works; 3. to distribute copies or
   phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by
   means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
   Collective Works; 4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display
   publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
   transmission Derivative Works. 5.

      For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition: 1.
      Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
      exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
      rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
      performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work. 2.
      Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive
      right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights society or
      designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord
      You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
      compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act
      (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions). 6. Webcasting Rights and
      Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound
      recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether
      individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),
      royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,
      subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
      Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

   1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
   digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
   include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with
   every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,
   publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
   any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
   recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense
   the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to
   the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,
   publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
   technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
   inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to
   the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
   Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
   this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor
   You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
   credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative
   Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
   remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as
   requested. 2. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
   publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this
   License, a later version of this License with the same License Elements as
   this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same
   License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan). You
   must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License
   or other license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or
   phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display,
   publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
   any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this
   License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You
   must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
   of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
   publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological
   measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
   the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work
   as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
   Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to
   the terms of this License. 3. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly
   perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
   Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
   provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of
   the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if
   the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.
   a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in
   Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means,
   the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the
   extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
   Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
   refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in
   the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
   the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
   Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such
   credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
   in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
   will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a
   manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK
AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
   upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
   who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this
   License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
   individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
   Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
   Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
   under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
   provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
   License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
   under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
   force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
   Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
   on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
   License. 2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
   Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
   Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
   this License. 3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
   under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
   the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
   parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
   extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 4. No term or
   provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to
   unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to
   be charged with such waiver or consent. 5. This License constitutes the
   entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
   There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
   the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional
   provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may
   not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

   of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical

   constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
   entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each

   (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made
   available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons
   jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License.

   expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an
   illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to
   geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
   phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a
   copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to
   the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.

  communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process,
  including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make
  available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may

under copyright law or other applicable laws.

duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

   1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
   Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

   2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
   including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
   label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
   Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
   translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The
   original work has been modified.";

   3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
   Collections; and, 4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. 5.

      For the avoidance of doubt: 1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In
      those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any
      statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
      reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
      You of the rights granted under this License;

         2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
         the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
         licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
         to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
         under this License; and,

         3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
         royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
         member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
         schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
         granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or

as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
   this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
   Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that
   restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the
   Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
   License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
   that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
   copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
   Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
   measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work
   from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
   the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
   Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work
   itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
   Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
   practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section
   4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
   Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
   credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.

   2. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms
   of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
   License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
   license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
   License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv)
   a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under
   one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that
   license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses
   mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply
   with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following
   provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable
   License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
   Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that
   restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient
   of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
   terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that
   refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with
   every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or
   Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
   Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the
   Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from
   You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
   Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
   incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart
   from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
   License.

   3. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
   Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
   4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
   to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
   (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
   and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
   institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
   Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
   reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
   Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
   any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
   does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
   and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a
   credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
   translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
   Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
   implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
   a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
   for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
   part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
   for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
   use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
   manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You
   may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
   sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
   Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
   the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,
   Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

   4. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
   otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
   Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
   Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
   action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original
   Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
   (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of
   this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
   distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial
   to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not
   assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
   applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
   under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
   otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
   upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
   who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
   however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
   entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
   7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
   Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
   under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
   provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
   License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
   under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
   force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
   Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
   conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

   2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
   offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
   conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

   3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
   remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
   parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
   extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
   consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
   the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

   5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
   respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
   representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
   not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
   communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
   written agreement of the Licensor and You.

   6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
   License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
   the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
   1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
   WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
   Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
   take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
   sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
   implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If
   the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
   additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are
   deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to
   restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

            containing Original Code or previous Modifications.

            B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or
            previous Modifications.

      1.10. ``Original Code'' means Source Code of computer software code which

      1.11. ``Source Code'' means the preferred form of the Covered Code for
      making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any

      comparisons against either the Original Code or another well known,
      available Covered Code of the Contributor's choice. The Source Code can be

      or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.

      1.12. ``You'' means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights

2. Source Code License.

      2.1. The Initial Developer Grant. The Initial Developer hereby grants You
      a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party
      intellectual property claims:

            (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
            distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without
            Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

            (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial
            Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the
            Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that
            any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the
            Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent
            that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or
            combinations.

      2.2. Contributor Grant. Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide,
      royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual
      property claims:

            (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
            distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or
            portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other
            Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and

            (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
            Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions
            thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is
            reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor
            Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that
            may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

3. Distribution Obligations.

      3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to
      which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including
      without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code
      may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future
      version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute.
      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that
      alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
      recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional
      document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to
      which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the
      terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or
      via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you
      made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
      months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
      made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
      the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to
      which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to
      create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a
      prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
      indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and
      including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and
      (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in
      which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

            (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an
            intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or
            its utilization under this License), you must include a text file
            with the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes
            the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a
            recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge
            after You make Your Modification available as described in Section
            3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make
            available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
            appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
            inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has
            been obtained.

            (b) Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application
            programming interface and You own or control patents which are
            reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include
            this information in the LEGAL file.

      3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each
      file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the
      Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered
      Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as
      a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible
      to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
      then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
      directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.
      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
      clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
      is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
      or liability terms You offer.

      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code
      in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been
      met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the
      Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of
      this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled
      the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code
      under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
      License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
      to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
      the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
      version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
      any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
      the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
      You offer.

      3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code
      with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
      the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure
      the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or
      regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
      maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
      they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described
      in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source
      Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
      description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
      skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached
      the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

      6.1. New Versions. Netscape Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may
      publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
      version will be given a distinguishing version number.

      6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a
      particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under
      the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
      under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
      Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms
      applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

      6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this
      License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not
      already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your
      license so that the phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'', ``MOZPL'',
      ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear
      anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version
      of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License
      and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
      Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit
      A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
      WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
      LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
      MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE
      RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
      SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
      INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
      NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
      CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE
      IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
      Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
      NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
      OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
      ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
      INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
      STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL
      DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
      TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
      NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
      JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
      YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

      The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48
      C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software''
      and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used
      in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
      C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End
      Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
      hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
      provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
      enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
      (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
      excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in
      which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or
      registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless
      otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License
      (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be
      subject to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying all
      costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall
      be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of
      JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall
      be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
      District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
      California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
      limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The
      application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
      International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
      which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against
      the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

      Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with
      Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or
      indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on
      the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you
      received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree
      to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable
      basis.
