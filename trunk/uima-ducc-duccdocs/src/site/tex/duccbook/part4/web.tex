\chapter{DUCC Web Server Customization}

    This chapter describes how to take advantage of DUCC Web Server plug-in
    capabilities in order to add local modifications.

    Prerequisites:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Apache UIMA-DUCC source code
      \item Ability to install DUCC (e.g. administrator)
    \end{enumerate}
   
	Why would you want to do this?  Perhaps you have some related information
	that your DUCC Web Server could display to the user community.  There are
	considerations for both the server and client sides.
	
	The following discussion is related to the downloaded DUCC source code,
	specifically the project {\em uima-ducc-web}.

\section{Server Side}

	In package {\em org.apache.uima.ducc.ws} you will find 
	{\em DuccPlugins.java} which you can modify or extend.
	
	During Web Server boot time, there are hooks to:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
      \item process each Job, Reservation, and Service restored from history
      \item add additional {\em http} request handlers
    \end{enumerate}
    
    During Web Server run time, there are hooks to:
    
	\begin{enumerate}
      \item process each Orchestrator publication
    \end{enumerate}
    
\section{Client Side}

	In folder {\em /src/main/webapp/root/js/} you will find 
	{\em ducc.local.js} which you can modify.
	
	During browser page load, there are hooks to:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
      \item perform additional initialization based on page type
    \end{enumerate}

	During browser page update, there are hooks to:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
      \item perform additional update based on page type
    \end{enumerate}
    
\section{Build and Install}   

	Build a new {\em uima-ducc-web-[version].jar} comprising the revised
	{\em DuccPlugins.class} and any additional dependent classes.
	Replace the vanilla {\em \$DUCC\_HOME/lib/uima-ducc/uima-ducc-web-[version].jar} 
	with the one containing your modifications.

	Copy your new ducc.local.js to the installed Web Server's 
	{\em \$DUCC\_HOME/webserver/root/js} directory.
	
	Start (or re-start) your Web Server.
	
	You may have to flush you browser's cache to pick up the new {\em ducc.local.js}.
