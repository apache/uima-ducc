\chapter{Job Logs}
\label{chap:job-logs}

The "user logs" are the Job Driver (JD) and Job Process (JP) logs. There is one JP log for each process 
of a job.  These hold the redirected stdout and stderr messages from user code as well as some DUCC-generated
messages.  These DUCC messages are managed by Apache log4j using the configuration file 
\duccruntime/resources/log4j.xml. It is not in the scope of this document to describe log4j or its
configuration mechanism. Details on log4j can be found at \url{http://logging.apache.org/log4j}.

\paragraph{Contents of the Log Directory} A number of other useful files are written to the log directory: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A properties file containing the full job specification for the job. This includes all the 
      parameters specified by the user as well as the default parameters. This file is called
      {\tt job-specification.properties.}
    \item The UIMA pipeline descriptor constructed by DUCC that describes the process that is 
      dispatched to each Job Process (JP). The name of this file is of the form 
\begin{verbatim}
         JOBID-uima-ae-descriptor-PROCESS.xml 
\end{verbatim}
      where 
      \begin{description}
          \item[JOBID] This is the numerical id of the job as assigned by DUCC.
          \item[PROCESS] This is the process id of the Job Driver (JD) process.
      \end{description}      

    \item The UIMA-AS service descriptor that defines the process that defines the job as as UIMAAS 
      service. The name of this file is of the form 
\begin{verbatim}
         JOBID-uima-as-dd-PROCESS.xml 
\end{verbatim}
      
      where 
      \begin{description}
         \item[JOBID] This is the numerical id of the job as assigned by DUCC.
         \item[PROCESS] This is the process id of the Job Driver (JD) process.
      \end{description}
      
    \item A colllection of gzipped ``json'' files containing the performance breakdown of the job.

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Job Process Logs}
The Job Process logs are written to the configured log directory.  There is one job process log
for every job processes started for the job.  The log names are of the following form:
\begin{verbatim}
         JOBID-TYPE-NODE-PROCESS.log 
\end{verbatim}
where 
\begin{description}
\item[JOBID] This is the numerical id of the job as assigned by DUCC.
\item[TYPE] This is either the string "UIMA" for JP logs, or "JD" for JD logs.
\item[NODE] This is the name of the machine where the process ran.
\item[PROCESS] This is the Unix process id of the process on the indicated node.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Job Driver Logs}
There are several Job Driver logs.
   988-JD-agent86-1-58087.log
   jd.out.log
   jd.err.log

\paragraph{Sample Log Directory}
This shows the contents a sample log directory for a small job that consisted of two processes.

\begin{verbatim}
    100-JD-node290-1-29383.log 
    100-uima-ae-descriptor-29383.xml 
    100-uima-as-dd-29383.xml 
    100-UIMA-node290-2-32766.log 
    100-UIMA-node291-63-13594.log 
    jd.out.log 
    job-specification.properties 
    job-performance-summary.json.gz
    job-processes-data.json.gz
    work-item-status.json.gz

\end{verbatim}

In this example, 

\begin{description}
     \item[100-JD-node290-1-29383.log]  \hfill \\
       is the diagnostic JD log, where the JD executed on node
       node290-1 in process 29383.

     \item[100-uima-ae-descriptor-29383.xml]  \hfill \\
       is the UIMA pipeline descriptor describing the
       service process that is launched in each JP, where the JD process is 29383.

     \item[100-uima-as-dd-29383.xml]  \hfill \\
       is the UIMA-AS service descriptor where the client is
       the JD process running in process 29383.

     \item[100-UIMA-node290-2-32766.log]  \hfill \\
       is a JP log for job 100, that ran on node
       node290-2, in process 32766.

     \item[100-UIMA-node291-63-13594.log]  \hfill \\
       is a JP log for job 100, that ran on node
       node291-63, in process 13594

     \item[ducc.log]  \hfill \\
       is the job state log file.

     \item[jd.err.log]  \hfill \\
       is the job error log file.

     \item[job-performance-summary.json.gz]  \hfill \\
       This contains the raw statistics describing
       the operation of each analytic.  It corresponds to \hyperref[subsec:performance]{Performance}
       tab of the Job Details page in the Web Server.

     \item[job-process.json.gz]  \hfill \\
       This contains the raw statistics describing
       the performance of each individual job process.  It corresponds \hyperref[subsec:ws-processes]{Processes}
       tab of the Job Details page in the Web Server.

     \item[work-item-state.json.gz]  \hfill \\
       This contains the raw statistics describing
       the operation of each individual work-item.  It corresponds to \hyperref[subsec:ws-work-items]{Work Items}
       tab of the Job Details page in the Web Server.
