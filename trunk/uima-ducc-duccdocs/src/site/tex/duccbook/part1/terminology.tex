\begin{description}

\item[Agent] DUCC Agent processes run on every node in the system. The Agent receives orders to
  start and stop processes on each node. Agents monitors nodes, sending heartbeat packets with node
  statistics to interested components (such as the RM and web-server). If CGroups are installed in
  the cluster, the Agent is responsible for managing the CGroups for each job process. All processes
  other than the DUCC management processes are are managed as children of the agents.

\item[Autostarted Service] An autostarted service is a registered service that is started automatically
  by DUCC when the DUCC system is booted.

\item[Dependent Service or Job] A dependent service or job is a service or job that specifies one
  or more service dependencies in their job specification. The service or job is dependent upon the
  referenced service being operational before being started by DUCC.

\item[DUCC] Distributed UIMA Cluster Computing.

\item[DUCC-MON]  DUCC-MON is the DUCC web-server.

\item[Job] A DUCC job consists of the components required to deploy and execute a UIMA pipeline over
  a computing cluster. It consists of a JD to run the Collection Reader, a set of JPs to run the UIMA
  AEs, and a Job Specification to describe how the parts fit together.

\item[Job Driver (JD)]The Job Driver is a thin wrapper that encapsulates a Job's Collection
  Reader. The JD executes as a process that is scheduled and deployed by DUCC.

\item[Job Process (JP)] The Job Process is a thin wrapper that encapsulates a job's pipeline
  components. The JP executes in a process that is scheduled and deployed by DUCC.

\item[Job Specification] The Job Specification is a collection of properties that describe work to be
  scheduled and deployed by DUCC. It
  identifies the UIMA components (CR, AE, etc) that comprise the job and the system-wide
  properties of the job (CLASSPATHs, RAM requirements, etc). 

\item[Machine] A physical computing resource managed by the DUCC Resource Manager.

\item[Node] See Machine.

\item[Orchestrator (OR)] The Orchestrator manages the life cycle of all entities within DUCC.

\item[Process] A process is one physical process executing on a machine in the DUCC cluster. DUCC
  jobs are comprised of one or more processes (JDs and JPs).  Each process is assigned one or
  more {\em shares} by the DUCC scheduler.

\item[Process Manager (PM) ] The Process Manager coordinates distribution of work among the Agents.

\item[Registered Service] A registered service is a service that is registered with DUCC. DUCC
  saves the service specification and fully manages the service, insuring it is running when needed,
  and shutdown when not.

\item[Resource Manager (RM) ] The Resource Manager schedules physical resources for DUCC work.

\item[Service Endpoint] In DUCC, the service endpoint provides a unique identifier for a service. In
  the case of UIMA-AS services, the endpoint also serves as a well-known address for contacting the
  service. 

\item[Service Instance] A service instance is one physical process which runs a CUSTOM or UIMA-AS
  service.  UIMA-AS services are usually scaled-out with multiple instances implementing the
  same underlying service logic.

\item[Service Manager (SM)] The Service Manager manages the life-cycles of UIMA-AS and CUSTOM
  services. It coordinates registration of services, starting and stopping of services, and ensures
  that services are available and remain available for the lifetime of the jobs.

\item[Share Quantum] The DUCC scheduler abstracts the nodes in the cluster as a single large
  conglomerate of resources: memory, processor cores, etc.  The scheduler logically decomposes 
  the collection of resources into some number of equal-sized atomic units.  Each unit of work requiring
  resources is apportioned one or more of these atomic units.  The smallest possible atomic 
  unit is called the {\em share quantum}, or simply, {\em share}.

\item[Weighted Fair Share] A weighted fair share calculation is used to apportion resources
  equitably to the outstanding work in the system.  In a non-weighted fair-share system, all
  work requests are given equal consideration to all resources.  To provide some (``more important'')
  work more than equal resources, weights are used to bias the allotment of shares in favor of
  some classes of work.

\item[Work Items] A DUCC work item is one unit of work to be completed in a single DUCC process. It
  is usually initiated by the submission of a single CAS from the JD to one of the JPs. It could be
  thought of as a single ``question'' to be answered by a UIMA analytic, or a single ``task'' to
  complete. Usually each DUCC JP executes many work items per job.

\item[\$DUCC\_HOME] The root of the installed DUCC runtime, e.g. /home/ducc/ducc\_runtime.  
  It need not be set in the environment, although the examples in this document assume that it has been.
