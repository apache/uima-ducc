# The first nodepool is the default nodepool which contains defaults for *all* nodepools.  
# There need not be any subpools of global or even nodes.  Any node not otherwise assigned
# to a nodepool is given to --default-- when it checks in.

# Specify 'default = true' in a fair-share class for job default
# Specify 'default = true' in a non-fair-share class for reservation default
# Specify the alternative debug class as 'debug = class'.  No default debug, use
#    inheritance as shown below

# Test: Top level npC that isn't parented by --default--
Nodepool --default--  { }
Nodepool npA            { nodefile npA.nodes ; parent --default-- }

Nodepool npE            { nodefile npE.nodes ; parent npB }

# Nnodepools may be defined with additional Nodepool statements.  For example here we define
# a nodpool as a subpool of the default:
#    Nodepool  subpool1 { parent = --default-- }
# Here we define a second 'top-level' nodepool with no parent, consisting of the nodes defined
# in the file toplevel1.nodes.
