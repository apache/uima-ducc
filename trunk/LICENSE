      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   1. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
   encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
   with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
   works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
   constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
   defined below) for the purposes of this License. 2. "Derivative Work" means a
   work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such
   as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization,
   motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
   condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed,
   or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
   considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
   avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
   recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
   image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of
   this License. 3. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the
   Work under the terms of this License. 4. "Original Author" means the
   individual or entity who created the Work. 5. "Work" means the copyrightable
   work of authorship offered under the terms of this License. 6. "You" means an
   individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not
   previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
   who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights
   under this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

   1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
   Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works; 2.
   to create and reproduce Derivative Works; 3. to distribute copies or
   phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by
   means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
   Collective Works; 4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display
   publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
   transmission Derivative Works. 5.

      For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition: 1.
      Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
      exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
      rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
      performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work. 2.
      Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive
      right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or
      designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord
      You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
      compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act
      (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions). 6. Webcasting Rights and
      Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound
      recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether
      individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),
      royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,
      subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
      Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

   1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
   digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
   include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with
   every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,
   publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
   any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
   recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense
   the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to
   the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,
   publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
   technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
   inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to
   the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
   Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
   this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor
   You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
   reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You
   create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
   extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
   Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. 2. If you distribute, publicly
   display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any
   Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright
   notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
   medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if
   applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if
   supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
   Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
   unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
   information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit
   identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French
   translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
   Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable
   manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
   Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
   comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
   such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLES OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
   upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
   who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this
   License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
   individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
   Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
   Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
   under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
   provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
   License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
   under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
   force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
   Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
   on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
   License. 2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
   Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
   Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
   this License. 3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
   under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
   the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
   parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
   extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 4. No term or
   provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to
   unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to
   be charged with such waiver or consent. 5. This License constitutes the
   entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
   There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
   the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional
   provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may
   not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

   Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other license specified in
   the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work
   You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
   perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that
   alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
   the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer
   to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
   publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
   Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or use of
   the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.
   The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective
   Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative
   Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. 3. If you
   distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform
   the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact
   all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
   reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
   pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
   Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
   Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
   unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
   information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit
   identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French
   translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
   Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable
   manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
   Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
   comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
   such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK
AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
   upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
   who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this
   License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
   individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
   Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
   Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
   under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
   provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
   License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
   under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
   force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
   Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
   on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
   License. 2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
   Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
   Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
   this License. 3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
   under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
   the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
   parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
   extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 4. No term or
   provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to
   unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to
   be charged with such waiver or consent. 5. This License constitutes the
   entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
   There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
   the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional
   provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may
   not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

License


Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related
Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the
following:

   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
   and translate a Work; 2. moral rights retained by the original author(s)
   and/or performer(s); 3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's
   image or likeness depicted in a Work; 4. rights protecting against unfair
   competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph
   4(a), below; 5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and
   reuse of data in a Work; 6. database rights (such as those arising under
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
   1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
   implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
   directive); and 7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights
   throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
   implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or
unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit
of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs
and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as
contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in
all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable
law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes
(the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial
invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise
any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in
either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
   surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. 2. Affirmer
   offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
   concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including
   without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
   particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other
   defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
   discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law. 3.
   Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that
   may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any
   person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
   disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or
   other rights required for any use of the Work. 4. Affirmer understands and
   acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no
   duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   1. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
   encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
   with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
   works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
   constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
   defined below) for the purposes of this License. 2. "Derivative Work" means a
   work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such
   as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization,
   motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
   condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed,
   or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
   considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
   avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
   recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
   image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of
   this License. 3. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the
   Work under the terms of this License. 4. "Original Author" means the
   individual or entity who created the Work. 5. "Work" means the copyrightable
   work of authorship offered under the terms of this License. 6. "You" means an
   individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not
   previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
   who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights
   under this License despite a previous violation. 7. "License Elements" means
   the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and
   indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

   1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
   Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works; 2.
   to create and reproduce Derivative Works; 3. to distribute copies or
   phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by
   means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
   Collective Works; 4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display
   publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
   transmission Derivative Works. 5.

      For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition: 1.
      Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
      exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
      rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
      performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work. 2.
      Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive
      right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights society or
      designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord
      You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
      compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act
      (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions). 6. Webcasting Rights and
      Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound
      recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether
      individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),
      royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,
      subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
      Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

   1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
   digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
   include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with
   every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,
   publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
   any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
   recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense
   the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to
   the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,
   publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
   technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
   inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to
   the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
   Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
   this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor
   You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
   credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative
   Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
   remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as
   requested. 2. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
   publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this
   License, a later version of this License with the same License Elements as
   this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same
   License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan). You
   must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License
   or other license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or
   phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display,
   publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
   any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this
   License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You
   must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
   of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
   publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological
   measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
   the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work
   as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
   Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to
   the terms of this License. 3. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly
   perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
   Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
   provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of
   the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if
   the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.
   a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in
   Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means,
   the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the
   extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
   Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
   refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in
   the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
   the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
   Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such
   credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
   in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
   will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a
   manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK
AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
   upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
   who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this
   License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
   individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
   Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
   Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
   under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
   provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
   License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
   under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
   force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
   Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
   on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
   License. 2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
   Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
   Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
   this License. 3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
   under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
   the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
   parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
   extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 4. No term or
   provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to
   unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to
   be charged with such waiver or consent. 5. This License constitutes the
   entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
   There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
   the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional
   provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may
   not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE

   other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including
   in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
   constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose
   of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical

   constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
   entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each

   illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to
   geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
   phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a
   copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to
   the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.

   Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

   2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
   including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
   label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
   Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
   translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The
   original work has been modified.";

   3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
   Collections; and, 4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. 5.

      For the avoidance of doubt: 1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In
      those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any
      statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
      reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
      You of the rights granted under this License;

         2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
         the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
         licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
         to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
         under this License; and,

         3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
         royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
         member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
         schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
         granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
   this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
   Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that
   restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the
   Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
   License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
   that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
   copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
   Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
   measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work
   from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
   the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
   Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work
   itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
   Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
   practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section
   4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
   Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
   credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.

   2. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms
   of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
   License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
   license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
   License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv)
   a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under
   one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that
   license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses
   mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply
   with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following
   provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable
   License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
   Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that
   restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient
   of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
   terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that
   refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with
   every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or
   Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
   Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the
   Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from
   You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
   Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
   incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart
   from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
   License.

   3. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
   Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
   4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
   to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
   (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
   and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
   institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
   Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
   reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
   Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
   any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
   does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
   and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a
   credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
   translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
   Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
   implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
   a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
   for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
   part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
   for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
   use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
   manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You
   may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
   sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
   Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
   the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,
   Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

   4. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
   otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
   Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
   Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
   action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original
   Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
   (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of
   this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
   distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial
   to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not
   assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
   applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
   under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
   otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
   upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
   who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
   however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
   entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
   7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
   Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
   under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
   provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
   License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
   under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
   force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
   Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
   conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

   2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
   offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
   conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

   3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
   remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
   parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
   extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
   consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
   the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

   5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
   respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
   representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
   not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
   communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
   written agreement of the Licensor and You.

   6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
   License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
   the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
   1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
   WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
   Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
   take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
   sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
   implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If
   the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
   additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are
   deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to
   restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

      a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party
      intellectual property claims:

            (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
            distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without
            Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

            (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial
            Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the
            Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that
            any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the
            Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent
            that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or
            combinations.

      2.2. Contributor Grant. Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide,
      royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual
      property claims:

            (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
            distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or
            portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other
            Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and

            (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
            Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions
            thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is
            reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor
            Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that
            may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

3. Distribution Obligations.

      3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to
      which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including
      without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code
      may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future
      version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute.
      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that
      alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
      recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional
      document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to
      which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the
      terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or
      via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you
      made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
      months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
      made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
      the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to
      which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to
      create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a
      prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
      indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and
      including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and
      (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in
      which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

            (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an
            intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or
            its utilization under this License), you must include a text file
            with the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes
            the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a
            recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge
            after You make Your Modification available as described in Section
            3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make
            available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
            appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
            inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has
            been obtained.

            (b) Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application
            programming interface and You own or control patents which are
            reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include
            this information in the LEGAL file.

      3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each
      file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the
      Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered
      Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as
      a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible
      to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
      then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
      directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.
      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
      clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
      is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
      or liability terms You offer.

      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code
      in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been
      met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the
      Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of
      this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled
      the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code
      under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
      License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
      to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
      the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
      version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
      any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
      the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
      You offer.

      3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code
      with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
      the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure
      the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or
      regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
      maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
      they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described
      in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source
      Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
      description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
      skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached
      the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

      6.1. New Versions. Netscape Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may
      publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
      version will be given a distinguishing version number.

      6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a
      particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under
      the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
      under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
      Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms
      applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

      6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this
      License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not
      already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your
      license so that the phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'', ``MOZPL'',
      ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear
      anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version
      of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License
      and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
      Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit
      A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
      WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
      LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
      MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE
      RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
      SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
      INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
      NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
      CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE
      IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
      Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
      NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
      OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
      ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
      INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
      STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL
      DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
      TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
      NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
      JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
      YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

      The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48
      C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software''
      and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used
      in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
      C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End
      Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
      hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
      provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
      enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
      (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
      excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in
      which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or
      registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless
      otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License
      (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be
      subject to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying all
      costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall
      be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of
      JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall
      be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
      District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
      California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
      limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The
      application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
      International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
      which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against
      the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

      Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with
      Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or
      indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on
      the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you
      received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree
      to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable
      basis.
