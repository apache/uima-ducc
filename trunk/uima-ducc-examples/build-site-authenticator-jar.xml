     * This is a sample ant script to build a jar file named
     * site-authenticator.jar comprising the sample class 
     * SiteSecurity.
     *
     * If one wanted to utilize this class for authentication 
     * (not recommended as-is since authentication always succeeds!)
     * one would build the jar file and then:
     * 1. include it and any of its dependency jars 
     *    (see build-site-authenticator-jar) in the directory
     *    ~ducc/ducc_runtime/lib/authentication
     * 2. update ducc.properties to include the property:
     *    ducc.local.jars authentication/*
