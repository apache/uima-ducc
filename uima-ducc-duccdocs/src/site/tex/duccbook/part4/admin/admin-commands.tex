\section{Administrative Commands}

   The administrative commands include a command to start DUCC, one to stop it, and one to 
   verify the configuration and query the state of the cluster.

   Note: The scripting that supports some of these functions runs (by default) in multi-threaded mode so
   large clusters can be started, stopped, and queried quickly.  If DUCC is running on an older
   system, the threading may not work right, in which case the scripts detect this and run
   single-threaded.  As well, all these commands support a ``--nothreading'' option to manually
   disable the threading.

\subsection{autostart.py}
\label{subsec:admin.autostart}

    \subsubsection{{\em Description}}
    The command \ducchome/admin/autostart.py is used to monitor and start DUCC daemons. 
    It is run individually by each node on the cluster, nominally invoked via crontab.
    It takes the following actions:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Queries the database autostart table for a list of DUCC daemons that should be running on this node.
      \item Queries the system for the actual DUCC daemons that are running on this node.
      \item Starts any DUCC daemon(s) found in the database not already running on this node.
    \end{itemize}

   Notes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The command start\_ducc puts or updates entries for each host and DUCC daemon in the database autostart table with state {\em Start}.
      \item The command stop\_ducc puts or updates entries for each host and DUCC daemon in the database autostart table with state {\em Stop}.
    \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{{\em Example crontab entry: }}

\begin{verbatim}
10 * * * * /share/Python-2.7.8/bin/python2.7 /home/ducc/ducc_runtime/admin/autostart.py 2>&1
\end{verbatim}   

\subsection{db\_autostart\_delete.py}
\label{subsec:admin.autostart.delete}

 \subsubsection{{\em Description}}
    The command \ducchome/admin/db\_autostart\_delete.py is used to remove entries from the autostart database table. 

  \subsubsection{{\em Usage}}

    \begin{description}
      \item[db\_autostart\_delete.py {[options]}] \hfill \\ 
        Specify host and name, both required. 
        If a corresponding entry is found in the autostart database table then it is deleted.
      \end{description}

  \subsubsection{{\em Options: }}
      \begin{description}
       \item[--host {[HOST]}] \hfill \\
          The HOST identifying the DUCC daemon entry to be deleted.
       \item[--name {[ag,br,or,pm,rm,sm,ws]}] \hfill \\
          The NAME identifying the DUCC daemon entry to be deleted.
      \end{description}
      
  \subsubsection{{\em Example: }}
  
\begin{verbatim}
> db_autostart_delete.py --host host601 --name ag
> deleted
\end{verbatim}      
      
\subsection{db\_autostart\_query.py}
\label{subsec:admin.autostart.query}

 \subsubsection{{\em Description}}
    The command \ducchome/admin/db\_autostart\_query.py is used to list entries in the autostart database table. 
      
  \subsubsection{{\em Example: }}
  
\begin{verbatim}
> db_autostart_query.py
> host603.br=Start
> host603.or=Start
> host603.pm=Start
> host603.rm=Start
> host603.sm=Start
> host603.ws=Start
> host428.ag=Start
> host439.ag=Start
> host430.ag=Start
> host340.ag=Start
> host679.ag=Start
\end{verbatim}   

\subsection{start\_ducc}
\label{subsec:admin.start-ducc}

    \subsubsection{{\em Description}}
    The command \ducchome/admin/start\_ducc is used to start DUCC processes. 
    It must be run from the head node.
    If run with no parameters it takes the following actions:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Starts the ActiveMQ server.
      \item Starts the database.
      \item Starts the management processes Resource Manager, Orchestrator, Process Manager,      
      Services Manager, and Web Server on the local node.
      \item Starts an agent process on every node named in the default node list. 
    \end{itemize}
    
    Exceptions:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item When running reliable DUCC, agents are not started from any backup node.
      \item When ducc.broker.autostart = false, the ActiveMQ server will not be started.
      \item When ducc.database.autostart = false, the database will not be started.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{{\em Usage}}

    \begin{description}
      \item[start\_ducc {[options]}] \hfill \\ 
        If no options are given, all DUCC processes are started, using the default node list, 
        {\em ducc.nodes}. 
      
      \end{description}
      
      \subsubsection{{\em Options: }}
      \begin{description}

        \item[-n, --nodelist {[nodefile] }] \hfill \\
          Start agents on the nodes in the nodefile. Multiple nodefiles may be specified: 
\begin{verbatim}
start_ducc -n foo.nodes -n bar.nodes -n baz.nodes 
\end{verbatim}
          

        \item[-c, --component {[component] }] \hfill \\
          Start a specific DUCC component, optionally on a specific node. If the component 
          name is qualified with a nodename, the component is started on that node. To qualify 
          a component name with a destination node, use the notation component@nodename. 
          Multiple components may be specified: 
\begin{verbatim}
start_ducc -c sm -c pm -c rm -c or@bj22 -c agent@n1 -c agent@n2 
\end{verbatim}
          
          Components include: 
          \begin{description}
            \item[rm] The Resource Manager
            \item[or]The Orchestrator
            \item[pm]The Process Manager
            \item[sm]The Service Manager
            \item[ws]The Web Server
            \item[agent@node] Node Agents
            \item[broker] ActiveMQ broker
            \item[db] Database
            \item[head] All of the above, except Node Agents
          \end{description}

          \item[--nothreading] If specified, the command does not run in multi-threaded mode
            even if it is supported on the local platform.

      \end{description}

      \subsubsection{{\em Notes: }}
      A different nodelist may be used to specify where Agents are started. As well multiple node 
      lists may be specified, in which case Agents are started on all the nodes in the multiple node 
      lists. 
      
      To start only agents, run start\_ducc specifying a nodelist explicitly. Note that the broker
      must have already been started.
      
      Files in the nodelist ending with suffix .regex are skipped.
      
      To start a specific management process, run start\_ducc with the -c component parameter, 
      specify the component that should be started. 
      
      \subsubsection{{\em Examples: }}

      Start some nodes from two different nodelist and start the broker.  
\begin{verbatim}
        start_ducc -n foo.nodes -n bar.nodes -c broker
\end{verbatim}
                  
      Start an agent on a specific node: 
\begin{verbatim}
        start_ducc -c agent@a.specific.node 
\end{verbatim}
      
      Start the webserver on node 'bingle': 
\begin{verbatim}
        start_ducc -c ws@bingle 
\end{verbatim}

      \subsubsection{{\em Debugging:}}

      Sometimes something will not start and it can be difficult to understand why.  To diagnose, it is
      helpful to know that {\em start\_ducc} is simply a wrapper around a lower-level bit of scripting
      that does the actual work.  That lower-level code can be invoked stand-alone, in which case
      console messages that {\em start\_ducc} will have suppressed are presented to the console.

      The lower-level script is called {\em ducc.py} and accepts the same {\em -c component} flag as
      start\_ducc.  If some component will not start, try running {\em ducc.py -c component} directly.
      It will start in the foreground and usually the cause of the problem becomes evident from
      the console.

      For example, suppose the Resource Manager will not start.  Run the following:
\begin{verbatim}
      ./ducc.py -c rm
\end{verbatim}
      and examine the output.  Use {\em CTL-C} to stop the component when done.
      
\subsection{stop\_ducc}
\label{subsec:admin.stop-ducc}

    \subsubsection{{\em Description:}}
    Stop one or more DUCC daemons.
    
    \subsubsection{\em Usage:}
    
\begin{verbatim}
     stop_ducc [-h]
               (--all | --head | --agents | --nodelist NODELIST | --component COMPONENT)
               (--kill | --stop [STOP] | --quiesce-then-stop)
               [--maxthreads MAXTHREADS] [--debug]
\end{verbatim}

      \subsubsection{Options:}
        
\begin{verbatim}
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --all                 Stop all DUCC management and agent processes by using
                        database entries recorded by start_ducc. Only allowed
                        if --kill option is also specified.
  --head                Stop the DUCC management processes on the present head
                        node by using database entries recorded by start_ducc.
  --agents              Stop the DUCC agents processes on all nodes by using
                        database entries recorded by start_ducc.
  --nodelist NODELIST, -n NODELIST
                        Stop agents on the nodes in the nodefile. Multiple
                        nodefiles may be specified.
  --component COMPONENT, -c COMPONENT
                        Stop a specific component. The component may be
                        qualified with the node name using the @ symbol:
                        component@node. If node is not specified, then the
                        localhost is presumed. Multiple components may be
                        specified. components = ['agent', 'pm', 'rm', 'sm',
                        'or', 'ws', 'broker', 'database']. Specification of a
                        head node component other than on the present head
                        node is disallowed unless --kill option is also
                        specified. Specification of broker or database is
                        disallowed unless that component is automanaged by
                        DUCC.
  --kill, -k            Stop the component(s) forcibly and immediately using
                        ssh with kill -9. Use this only if a normal stop does
                        not work (e.g. the process may be hung).
  --stop [STOP], -s [STOP]
                        Stop the component(s) gracefully using broadcast.
                        Agents allow children specified time (in seconds) to
                        exit. Default is 60. Broadcast is not used for broker
                        and database, instead a direct kill -15 is employed.
  --quiesce-then-stop, -q
                        Stop the component(s) gracefully using broadcast.
                        Agents exit only when no children exist. Children are
                        given infinite time to exit.
  --maxthreads MAXTHREADS, -m MAXTHREADS
                        Maximum concurrent threads. Default = 10.
  --debug, -d           Display debugging messages.
\end{verbatim}

      \subsubsection{Notes:}
\begin{verbatim}
N1. stop_ducc is limited to running on a head node.
N2. stop_ducc updates database autostart table with "stop" status.
N3. stop_ducc --kill option employs ssh with kill -9.
N4. stop_ducc --stop and --quiesce-then-stop options employ broadcast via broker.
    The broker and database are exceptions, whereby ssh with kill -15 is employed.
\end{verbatim}

      \subsubsection{Examples:}
\begin{verbatim}
E1. kill all daemons that were started, as recorded in the database autostart table
> stop_ducc --all --kill

E2. stop all head node daemons on the present node
> stop_ducc --head --stop

E3. stop all agents via broadcast, each will issue kill -15 to children
    then exit after a maximum of 60 seconds, by default
> stop_ducc --agents --stop

E4. quiesce all agents, each will issue kill -15 to children then exit only
    after all children have exited
> stop_ducc --agents --quiesce-then-stop

E5. quiesce agents listed in groupA.nodes and groupB.nodes, each will issue kill -15
    to children then exit only after all children have exited
> stop_ducc --nodelist groupA.nodes --nodelist groupB.nodes --quiesce-then-stop

E6. stop agents on nodes nodeC8 and nodeD5, each will issue kill -15
    to children then exit after a maximum of 90 seconds.
> stop_ducc --component agent@nodeC8 --component agent@nodeD5 --stop 90

E7. stop orchestrator
> stop_ducc --component or --stop

E8. kill orchestrator on alternate head node nodeX3
> stop_ducc --component or@nodeX3 --kill
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{check\_ducc}
\label{subsec:admin.check-ducc}
    \subsubsection{{\em Description:}}

    Check\_ducc is used to verify the integrity of the DUCC installation and to find and report on
    DUCC processes. It identifies processes owned by ducc (management processes, agents,
    and job processes), and processes started by DUCC on behalf of users.
    
    \subsubsection{\em{Usage: }}

        \begin{description} 
          \item[check\_ducc {[options]}]
              If no options are given this is the equivalent of: 
\begin{verbatim}
check_ducc -c -n ../resources/ducc.nodes 
\end{verbatim}
              
              This verifies the integrity of the DUCC installation and searches for all the
              processes owned by user {\em ducc} and started by DUCC on all the nodes in ducc.nodes.
        \end{description}
            
     \subsubsection{\em{Options:}}
         \begin{description}
           \item[-n --nodelist {[nodefile]}]
             Only the nodes specified in the nodefile are searched. The option may be specified 
             multiple times for multiple nodefiles. Note that the "local" node is always checked as well. 
\begin{verbatim}
check_ducc -n nlist1 -n nlist2 
\end{verbatim}
                       
           \item[-c --configuration]
             Verify the \hyperref[sec:ducc.classes]{Resource Manager configuration}.

            \item[--nothreading] If specified, the command does not run in multi-threaded mode
              even if it is supported on the local platform.

 			\item[-x localdate] Validate the local installation, called via ssh usually. The date is the date on the calling machine.

            \item[-v, --verbose] \hfill \\
              When specified with {\em -c} to check the configuration, this emits a formatted version
              of the node list showing the full structure of the scheduling classes.
              
           \end{description}               

   \subsubsection{{\em Notes:}}
   
      Files in the nodelist ending with suffix .regex are skipped.
            
\subsection{build\_duccling}
\label{subsec:admin.build-duccling}

    See ~\ref{sec:duccling.install} on Ducc\_ling Configuration.


\subsection{ducc\_disk\_info}
\label{subsec:admin.ducc-disk-info}
    \subsubsection{{\em Description:}}

    The disk info tool is used to obtain information about DUCC disk usage. 
    
    \paragraph{Usage:}
        This command nominally takes no parameters.
        
    \paragraph{Options:}
    \begin{description}
      	\item -h, --help      Prints the usage text to the console. 
      	\item -c, --code      Prints the exit code, which is the greater of disk usage percentage and quota usage percentage. 
      	\item -d, --debug     Prints internal debugging information, intended for DUCC developers or extended problem determination.
      	\item -n, --nomsg     Suppress display of filesystem and quota percentages used message. 
    \end{description}       


\subsection{ducc\_gather\_logs}
\label{subsec:admin.ducc-gather-logs}
    \subsubsection{{\em Description:}}

    Purpose: gather problem determination information comprising DUCC logs and configuration data into a gz file.
    
    \paragraph{Usage:}
        This command nominally takes no parameters.
        
    \paragraph{Options:}
    \begin{description}
      	\item -h, --help      Prints the usage text to the console. 
      	\item -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY     Path to directory for gz file, default=/tmp.
    \end{description}       
    

\subsection{ducc\_post\_install}
\label{subsec:admin.ducc-post-install}

    \paragraph{Description:}
    The post-installation script must be run only after the first installation of DUCC. 
    When updating an existing installation use the \hyperref[subsec:admin.ducc-update]{\em ducc\_update}
    script.
    ducc\_post\_install performs these tasks:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Verifies that the correct level of Java and Python are installed and available.
      \item Creates a default nodelist, \duccruntime/resources/ducc.nodes, containing the name of the node you are installing on.
      \item Defines the ``ducc head'' node to be the node you are installing from.
      \item Initializes the database.
      \item Sets up the default https keystore for the webserver.
      \item Installs the DUCC documentation ``ducc book'' into the DUCC webserver root.
      \item Builds and installs the C program, ``ducc\_ling'', into the default location.
      \item Ensures that the (supplied) ActiveMQ broker is runnable.
    \end{enumerate}

    Once the script completes successfully \hyperref[subsec:admin.start-ducc]{\em start\_ducc} will run a single-user/unprivileged DUCC.

    \paragraph{Notes:}
    If the script is rerun it will rename the previously created files so any customizations applied
    can be recovered.

\subsection{ducc\_update}
\label{subsec:admin.ducc-update}

    \paragraph{Description:}
        This command is used to unpack a new release of DUCC and create a new installation or update
        an existing one.
        For a new installation it simply unpacks the tar file with the appropriate permissions.
        The setup must be completed by running \hyperref[subsec:admin.ducc-post-install]{\em ducc\_post\_install}.

        When updating an existing installation it performs the following actions:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Checks that DUCC is not running.
          \item Creates a site.ducc.properties file if updating from DUCC 1.1.0.
          \item Creates a time-stamped archive directory to hold the old runtime.
          \item Archives current files before updating them, except for the customizable ones.
          \item Leaves in place any files added to the directories that may hold site-specific files.
          \item Reports which are replaced, added, or kept.
          \item Rebuilds the non-privileged ducc\_ling.
        \end{enumerate}

        The site-specific files, those holding customizations such as node and class definitions
        as well as logs and job history, are left in place, 
        while all replaced files are archived under a folder called {\em ducc\_archives} 
        so the previous installation can be restored if necessary.

        Note that the update does not create the database.  After updating from a version prior
        to 2.1.0 using the file-based persistent scheme the database should be created with
        \hyperref[subsec:admin.db-create]{\em db\_create} 
        and the files holding state such as job history and service registrations loaded into the database with
        \hyperref[subsec:admin.db-loader]{\em db\_loader}.
        If this conversion is omitted DUCC will continue to use the file-based scheme but with some
        loss of functionality that the database design would provide.
        
    \paragraph{Usage:}
        This command takes two parameters, a pointer to the DUCC\_HOME to be updated or created,
        and the name of the tar file containing the new build.
    \begin{description}
      \item[ducc\_update {\em some-ducc-home} {\em binary-tar-file}]
        Update an existing DUCC installation or install a new one.
    \end{description}

    \paragraph{Arguments:}
    \begin{description}
        \item[{\em some-ducc-home}] 
          This specifies the DUCC\_HOME you wish to create or update.  If it doesn't exist a new
          installation is created, otherwise it is updated.
        \item[{\em binary-tar-file}]
          The name of the binary tar file containing the new build.
     \end{description}

    \paragraph{Example:}
        If this is the first installation or the current installation does not contain the
        ducc\_update script you can first extract it from the tar file. 
\begin{verbatim}
tar --no-anchored -zxf uima-ducc-2.1.0-bin.tar.gz ducc_update
apache-uima-ducc-2.1.0/admin/ducc_update /home/ducc/ducc_runtime uima-ducc-2.1.0-bin.tar.gz 
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{rm\_reconfigure}
\label{subsec:admin.rm-reconfigure}

    \subsubsection{{\em Description:}}
    Rm\_reconfigure is used to force the Resource Manager (RM) to reread all its configuration
    files and reconfigure itself accordingly, without the need to fully stop and restart RM.
    This is generally much faster than RM restart and avoids losing most state messages from
    the other DUCC processes.
    
    The {\em rm\_reconfigure} command first performs a 
    \hyperref[sec:admin.properties-merge]{properties merge.}

    RM then validates the new
    configuration, and if no errors are found, saves certain information such as current node
    online-offline status.  It then rereads the following configuration files and rebuilds its
    internal structures accordingly:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item ducc.properties (after merging default.ducc.properties and site.ducc.properties,
      \item ducc.classes,
      \item log4j.xml.
    \end{itemize}
    The saved configuration is then restored into the newly configured structures.
    On receipt of the next Orchestrator state, the RM fully rebuilds its state from the current
    DUCC load and scheduling restarts.

    Depending on the nature of the new configuration, the current load may be adjusted; for
    example, if the weight of a fair-share class is changed, preemptions or extra allocations
    may be performed.

    If the new configuration is not consistent with the current load, a number of more drastic
    adjustments will be performed:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If a fair-share class is deleted, all existing jobs for that class are preempted
        and a {\em refusal} message is sent to the Orchestrator for each affected job.
      \item If a fair-share class is redefined over a different nodepool such that existing
        work are no longer legally scheduled, any shares allocated over inappropriate
        hosts are {\em preempted}.  As soon as the preemptions are acknowledged, the RM
        will reschedule the shares over the differently-configured resources.
      \item If a non-preemptable class is deleted or reconfigured so existing non-preempt able
        work is no longer allocated correctly, the following will occur:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If the shares are for services, they are deallocated and a {\em refusal} is
              sent to the Orchestrator.  The Service Manager will observe this and restart the
              processes, causing them to be reallocated over the changed configuration.
            \item Otherwise, the RM leaves the allocation in place, but places the hosts on an
              internal {\em blacklist}, preventing subsequent scheduling to those hosts. Once
              the (now) incorrectly placed shares are freed (e.g. by canceling a reservation or
              exit of a managed reservation), the hosts are again white listed and made available
              for scheduling.
        \end{itemize}
     \end{itemize}
        
    In short, the RM makes every effort to avoid disturbing existing allocations, and blacklists
    hosts that are no longer consistently configured for the current load, until such time as
    the allocations on those hosts are released.

\subsection{rm\_qload}
\label{subsec:admin.rm-qload}

    \subsubsection{{\em Description:}}
    Rm\_qload is used to query the Resource Manager's scheduling tables to determine the
    current demand and capacity of the system, as the RM sees it.  The primary purpose
    is to provide information to adjunct resource managers (such as a ``cloud'') to
    determine the current needs, or lack thereof, of the system.  The administrative
    command is implemented as a Python script that interacts with the underlying
    Java ``RmQueryLoadReply'' API and is provided mostly as an example of how
    scripting can be used to interact with the RM.

    After displaying the current scheduling quantum, the response is provided in two sections:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Information showing the current demand and usage of resource classes, and
      \item Information showing the current nodepool usage.
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsubsection{\em Class section}
    Three lines are emitted per class:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The name of the class and its scheduling policy,
      \item A line showing the {\em demand}, or {\em request} by quantum, on the class, and
      \item A line showing the {\em usage}, or {\em award}, by quantum on the class.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    The numbers shown for {\em request} and {\em award} show the number of processes, by
    memory, in terms of scheduling quantum, for each class.  For example, assuming the
    scheduling quantum is 15GB, the following shows:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Five processes of quantum 2 (15-30GB) are requested, but only two have been awarded,
      \item Three processes of quantum 3 (31-45GB) are requested and all have been awarded,
      \item Four processes of quantum 4 (46-60GB) are requested, and two have been awarded.
    \end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}
Class normal policy FAIR_SHARE
   requested    0    0    5    3    4    0    0    0    0 
   awarded      0    0    2    3    2    0    0    0    0 
\end{verbatim}

    \subsubsection{\em Nodepool section}
    Six lines are displayed for each nodepool:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The name of the nodepool,
      \item A summary showing the number hosts in the pool which are online, dead (unresponsive), and
          varied-off, the total quantum shares available to the nodepool, and the total unscheduled or 
          {\em free} shares.
      \item The number of hosts known to the nodepool, by quantum, similar to the class listings above,
      \item The nubmer of online hosts, by quantum,
      \item The number of completely free hosts by quantum (no work currently scheduled), and
      \item The number of {\em virtual} hosts, by quantum.  A {\em virtual host} is created when a
          host is partially scheduled.  For example, if a 32G processes is scheduled on a 64G host, this
          creates one free 32G {\em virtual host}.
    \end{enumerate}
    To determine the number of processes, by quantum, that can be scheduled, one must {\em sum} the
    ``free'' and ``virtual'' columns.
    
    For example, (assuming a 15GB quantum), the following listing shows
    that nodepool ``power'' contains fourteen hosts with at least 45GB each (3 quanta).  Two
    of these hosts have something scheduled on them (the ``free
    machines'' line), leaving unused space of one 15G quantum on one
    host, and one 30GB quantum on another host.

\begin{verbatim}
Nodepool power
   online 14 dead 0 offline 0 total-shares 42 free-shares 42
   all     machines:    0    0    0   14    0    0    0    0    0 
   online  machines:    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0 
   free    machines:    0    0    0   12    0    0    0    0    0 
   virtual machines:    0    1    1    0    0    0    0    0    0

\subsection{rm\_qoccupancy}
\label{subsec:admin.rm-qoccupancy}

    \subsubsection{{\em Description:}}
    Rm\_qoccupancy provides a list of all known hosts to the RM, and for each host, the following information:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The name of the host,
      \item Whether the host has any blacklists processes on it,
      \item Whether the host is currently online (responsive),
      \item The status of the host; whether the host is schedulable ({\em up} or {\em down}.  A responsive host becomes
        unschedulable ({\em down}) if it is varied-off,
      \item The nodepool the host is a member of,
      \item The reported memory size of the host, 
      \item The {\em order} of the host.  The {\em order} is defined to be the maximum number of quantum shares
        supported by the host,
      \item The number of unscheduled quantum shares on the host, and
      \item If work is scheduled on the host, information relevant to that scheduled processes (or reservation).
    \end{itemize}

    If work is scheduled on a host, the work summary is keyed thus:
    \begin{description}
      \item[J] The Orchestrator-assigned job id of the work,
      \item[S] The RM-assigned share id of the work,
      \item[O] The {\em order} of the allocation; that is, the number of quantum shares the allocation occupies,
      \item[II] The {\em initialization investment}; the number of milliseconds the allocated work spent in its
        initialization phase, if any (usually only UIMA-AS processes display this),
      \item[IR] The {\em runtime investment}; the number of milliseconds spent processing the current CASs, if this
        is a UIMA-AS processes.  Note that this number can change dramatically, as it is the sum of time spent only
        by the current CASs.  When a CAS completes, it no longer contributes to the investment of the process.  The RM
        uses this information to determine the best candidate for eviction, if needed ot maintain fair-share.
      \item[E] Whether the RM has preempted (evicted) the process but it has not yet exited,
      \item[P] Whether the RM has purged the process (evicted, because the host is non-responsive), but it has not
        been confirmed evicted,
      \item[F] Whether the process is {\em fixed}; that is, non-preemptable,
      \item[I] Whether the initialization phase is completed (usually only UIMA-AS processes).
    \end{description}

    The following example shows seven hosts, one with a preemptable share in the {\em --default--}
    nodepool (on bluej290-5), and one with a non-preemptable share in the {\em jobdriver} nodepool.
\begin{verbatim}

\subsection{vary\_off}
\label{subsec:admin.vary-off}
    \subsubsection{{\em Description:}}

    Vary\_off is used to remove a host from scheduling and to evict the preemptable work that is running on it.
    This allows for graceful clearance of a host so the host can be take offline for maintenance,
    or any other purpose (such as sharing the host with other applications.)  
    The DUCC agent is NOT stopped; use \hyperref[subsec:admin.stop-ducc]{stop\_ducc} to stop the
    agent.  
    Managed and unmanaged reservations are not canceled by {\em vary\_off}.
    
    Only the userid that started DUCC may issue {\em vary\_off}; attempts from other userids
    are rejected.

    \subsubsection{\em{Usage: }}

        \begin{description} 
          \item[vary\_off list-of-hosts]
            The {\em list-of-nodes} is a space delimited list of hosts to be removed from
              scheduling in the DUCC cluster.
        \end{description}
            
\subsection{vary\_on}
\label{subsec:admin.vary-on}
    \subsubsection{{\em Description:}}

    Vary\_on is used to restore a host to scheduling by DUCC.  If the agent is still
    alive the host becomes immediately available.  The agent is not started by
    {\em vary\_on}; use use 
    \hyperref[subsec:admin.start-ducc]{start\_ducc} to start the agent if needed.

    Only the userid that started DUCC may issue {\em vary\_on}; attempts from other userids
    are rejected.
    
    \subsubsection{\em{Usage: }}

        \begin{description}

\subsection{ducc\_properties\_manager}
\label{sec:cli.ducc-properties-manager}

    \paragraph{Description:}
    This CLI is used to manually merge or difference two properties files. 

    Normally, the DUCC scripts {\em start\_ducc, check\_ducc,}, and {\em rm\_configure} automatically
    merge the file {\em default.ducc.properties} and {\em site.ducc.properties} when invoked.  

    \paragraph{Usage:}
    \begin{description}
    \item[ducc\_props\_manager --merge file1 --with file2 --to file3]
      Merge two properties files into one.  Properties added to, or changed in, the second file
      are used to override those in the first file, with the result written to the third file.
    \item[ducc\_props\_manager --delta file1 --with file2 --to file3]
      Compare two properties files and write the differences into a third file.  The first file is
      considered a ``master'' file.  Properties with different values in the second file, or which
      do not occur in the first file, are written into the third file.
    \end{description}

    \paragraph{Options:}
    \begin{description}
        \item[$--$merge file1]          
          In this form, the two files specified in the {\em $--$with} and {\em$--$to} fields are merged, with the
          results placed in $--$file3.  Overrides are flagged with a change tag and the date of the merge.

          {\em file1} is considered the ``master'' properties file and is usually the unmodified file provided
          with the DUCC distribution, {\em default.ducc.properties}.

          {\em file2} is considered a set of override or additional properties and is usually the site local
          properties file, {\em site.ducc.properties.}

        \item[$--$delta file1]
          In this form, the two files specified in the {\em $--$with} and {\em$--$to} fields are compared, with
          differences placed in $--$file3.

          {\em file1} is considered the ``master'' properties file and is usually the unmodified file provided
          with the DUCC distribution, {\em default.ducc.properties}.
          
          {\em file2} is considered the ``external'' properties file and is usually the properties file from
          an older version of DUCC.  

          Differences are placed in {\em $--$file3} which may be a viable first cut at a new {\em site.ducc.properties.}

          \item[$--$with file2] This specifies the properties file to merge with the master, or to difference
            with the master properties file.

          \item[$--$to file3] This specifies the file to which the results of the merge or delta are written.
     \end{description}
        
    \paragraph{Notes:}
    None.

\subsection{db\_create}
\label{subsec:admin.db-create}

    \paragraph{Description:}
        This command is used to initialize the database.  Normally the database is initialized
        during {\em ducc\_post\_install} but if this is an existing DUCC installation that is 
        being migrated from a version that does not use the database, it will be necessary to
        initialize the database with this command.

        This command performs the following actions:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Starts the database.
          \item Disables the default database superuser.
          \item Installs a database superuser as ``ducc'' and sets the password
            to a random string.  The password is saved
            in DUCC\_HOME/resources.private/ducc.private.properties.
          \item Installs the DUCC database schema.
          \item Stops the database.
        \end{enumerate}
        

         This command takes no parameters.

         NOTE: The database user and password are NOT RELATED to any login ID on the system,
         they are used and maintained by the database only.

\subsection{db\_loader}
\label{subsec:admin.db-loader}

    \paragraph{Description:}
        This command is used to copy the data from DUCC's older (pre 2.1.0) file-based persistence
        into the database.  The database schema must already exist, created either
        with {\em ducc\_post\_install} or with {\em db\_create}.

        This command performs the following actions:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Starts the database.
          \item Drops some of the indexes in the database.
          \item Loads the Orchestrator checkpoint file from {\em DUCC\_HOME/state/orchestrator.chkpt}.
          \item Loads all job history from {\em DUCC\_HOME/history/jobs}.
          \item Loads all reservation history from {\em DUCC\_HOME/history/reservations}.
          \item Loads all service instance and AP history from {\em DUCC\_HOME/history/services}.
          \item Loads the service registry from {\em DUCC\_HOME/state/services}.
          \item Loads the service registry history from {\em DUCC\_HOME/history/service-registry}.  
          \item Reloads the Orchestrator checkpoint, as a spot-check of the loader's instrumentation (to insure
            load times stay reasonable.)
          \item Re-installs the DUCC database schema.
          \item Stops the database.
          \item Optionally renames the file-based state so if you rerun the command, the data does not get reloaded.
        \end{enumerate}
        
        When the command exits, DUCC should be ready to run with all its state in the database.

        This command takes two parameters, a pointer to the DUCC\_HOME you want to load from, and
        a flag to disable the rename of the file-based state.

    \paragraph{Usage:}
    \begin{description}
    \item[db\_loader -i {\em some-ducc-home} {[--no-archive]}]
      Load the database from the specified DUCC\_HOME, and optionally do not archive the original files
      by renaming them.  
    \end{description}

    \paragraph{Options:}
    \begin{description}
        \item[$-i$ {\em some-ducc-home}] 
          This specifies the DUCC\_HOME you wish to load.  Most of the time it is the DUCC\_HOME you
          are running within, but it can be some other DUCC\_HOME if you have multiple installations and
          want other history and state loaded.
        \item[$--no-archive$] 
          If specified, the original files are not renamed.  Note that only the directories in {\em history}
          and {\em state} are renamed.  To restore these, simply rename them back without the {\em archive}
          suffix.
     \end{description}
        
    \paragraph{Example:}
\begin{verbatim}
db_loader -i /home/ducc/ducc_runtime
db_loader -i /home/ducc.old/ducc_runtime --no-archive
\end{verbatim}

    \paragraph{Notes:}
    The console shows progress of the loader.  Full details of the load are written to a log {\em db-loader-log}
    in the usual DUCC log directory, for reference and potential problem determination if something goes wrong.
    
    
\subsection{db\_tool}
\label{subsec:admin.db-tool}

    \paragraph{Description:}
        This command is used to backup and restore DUCC's database.
        
    \paragraph{Options:}
    Exactly one of the following options is required.
    \begin{description}
	        \item[$--$save {\em PATH.tar.gz}] 
	          The file to save the DUCC database contents.  The database must be up.  The file cannot already exist.
       		\item[$--$save-overwrite {\em PATH.tar.gz}] 
	          The file to save the DUCC database contents.  The database must be up.
	        \item[$--$restore {\em PATH.tar.gz}] 
	          The file to restore the DUCC database contents.  The database must be down.  The database directory cannot exist.
	        \item[$--$restore-overwrite {\em PATH.tar.gz}] 
	          The file to restore the DUCC database contents.  The database must be down.
     \end{description}
	 The following options are optional and are mutually exclusive with each other.
	 \begin{description}
	        \item[$--$verbose] 
	          Print extra debug messages.
       		\item[$--$quiet] 
	          Print no informational messages.
     \end{description}
	 
    \paragraph{Example:}
\begin{verbatim}
db_tool --save-overwrite /backups/ducc/ducc_db.tar.gz
db_tool --restore-overwrite /backups/ducc/ducc_db.tar.gz --verbose
\end{verbatim}

    \paragraph{Notes:}
    The console shows progress of the db\_tool unless --quiet is specified.
