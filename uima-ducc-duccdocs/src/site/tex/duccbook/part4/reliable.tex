\chapter{Reliable DUCC}
\label{chap:reliable}

\section{Introduction}
    DUCC can be configured to run reliably by having multiple head nodes,
    comprising one {\em master} and one or more {\em backup} head nodes.
    DUCC exploits Linux {\em keepalived} virtual IP addressing to enable
    this capability.
    
    The advantages are that if the {\em master} DUCC host becomes
    unusable, the {\em backup} DUCC can take over seamlessly
    such that active distributed Jobs, Reservations, Managed Reservations 
    and Services continue uninterrupted.  Take over also facilitates
    continued acceptance of new submissions and monitoring of new and
    existing submissions without interruption.
        
\section{Configuring Host Machines}    
    See {\em Configuring Simple Virtual IP Address Failover Using Keepalived} 
    which can be found at this web address: 
    \url{https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E41138/html/section_uxg_lzh_nr.html}.

	Sample MASTER /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
	
	\begin{verbatim}
    ! Configuration File for keepalived

	vrrp_instance VI_1 {
	    state MASTER
	    interface eth0
	    virtual_router_id 51
	    priority 100
	    advert_int 1
	    authentication {
	        auth_type PASS
	        auth_pass 1111
	    }
	    virtual_ipaddress {
	        192.168.6.253
	    }
	}
   	\end{verbatim}

	Sample BACKUP /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
	
	\begin{verbatim}
    ! Configuration File for keepalived

	vrrp_instance VI_1 {
	    state BACKUP
	    interface eth0
	    virtual_router_id 51
	    priority 100
	    advert_int 1
	    authentication {
	        auth_type PASS
	        auth_pass 1111
	    }
	    virtual_ipaddress {
	        192.168.6.253
	    }
	}
   	\end{verbatim}
   	
	Linux Commands
	
	Starting keepalived
	
    \begin{verbatim}
    > sudo service keepalived start
    Starting keepalived:                                       [  OK  ]
   	\end{verbatim}
   	
   	Querying keepalived
	
    \begin{verbatim}
    > /sbin/ip addr show dev eth0
	2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP qlen 1000
	    link/ether 00:21:5e:20:02:84 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
	    inet 192.168.3.7/16 brd 192.168.255.255 scope global eth0
	    inet 192.168.6.253/32 scope global eth0
	    inet6 fe80::221:5eff:fe20:284/64 scope link 
	       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   	\end{verbatim}

	Stopping keepalived
	
    \begin{verbatim}
    > sudo service keepalived stop
    Stopping keepalived: 
   	\end{verbatim}

\section{Configuring DUCC}  
    To configure DUCC to run reliable, one required property must
    be configured in the {\em site.ducc.properties} file.  Example:
    
    \begin{verbatim}
	ducc.head = 192.168.6.253
   	\end{verbatim}
    
    Use the virtual IP address configured for your host machines keepalived. 
    Use of the DNS name is also supported. 
    
\section{Webserver}

	Webserver for Master

	The {\em master} DUCC Webserver will display all pages normally with additional
	information in the heading upper left:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	reliable: \textbf{master}
   	\end{verbatim}
	
	Webserver for Backup
	
	The {\em backup} DUCC Webserver will display some pages normally with additional
	information in the heading upper left:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	\underline{reliable}: \textbf{backup}
   	\end{verbatim}
   	
   	Hovering over \underline{reliable} will yield the following information:
   	{\em Click to visit master}
   	
   	Several pages will display the following information (or similar):
   	
   	\begin{verbatim}
	no data - not master
   	\end{verbatim}

\section{Database}

	Configure the database to be on a separate machine from the reliable DUCC head nodes.
	In {\em site.ducc.properties} specify:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	# Database location
    ducc.database.host = dbhost123
    ducc.database.jmx.host = dbhost123
    ducc.database.automanage = false
   	\end{verbatim}
   	
   	The existing administrator commands {\em start\_ducc} and {\em stop\_ducc} will
   	honor the value specified for {\em ducc.database.automanage} in {\em site.ducc.properties}.
