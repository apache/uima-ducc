\chapter{Command Line Interface}
\label{chap:cli}

    \paragraph{Overview}
    The DUCC CLI is the primary means of communication with DUCC.  Work is submitted, work is
    canceled, work is monitored, and work is queried with this interface.

    All parameters may be passed to all the CLI commands in the form of Unix-like ``long-form''
    (key, value) pairs, in which the key is proceeded by the characters ``$--$".  As well, the
    parameters may be saved in a standard Java Properties file, without the leading ``$--$''
    characters.  Both a properties file and command-line parameters may be passed to each CLI.  When
    both are present, the parameters on the command line take precedence.  Take, for example
    the following simple job properties file, call it {\tt 1.job}.
\begin{verbatim}
description                    Test job 1

classpath                      ../lib/uima-ducc-examples.jar
environment                    AE_INIT_TIME=5 AE_INIT_RANGE=5 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/a/nother/path
scheduling_class               normal

driver_descriptor_CR           org.apache.uima.ducc.test.randomsleep.FixedSleepCR
driver_descriptor_CR_overrides jobfile:1.inputs,compression:10,error_rate:0.0
driver_jvm_args                -Xmx500M

process_descriptor_AE          org.apache.uima.ducc.test.randomsleep.FixedSleepAE
process_memory_size            4
process_jvm_args               -Xmx100M 
process_thread_count           2
process_per_item_time_max      5
process_deployments_max        999

\end{verbatim}

    This can be submitted, overriding the scheduling class and memory, thus:
\begin{verbatim}
ducc_job_submit --specification 1.job --process_memory_size 16 --scheduling_class high
\end{verbatim}    

    The DUCC CLI parameters are now described in detail.

    \section{The DUCC Job Descriptor}
    The DUCC Job Descriptor includes properties to enable automated management and scale-out 
    over large computing clusters.  The job descriptor includes
    \begin{itemize}
      \item References to the various UIMA components required by the job (CR, CM, AE, CC, and maybe DD)
      \item Scale-out requirements: number of processes, number of threads per process, etc
      \item Environment requirements: log directory, working directory, environment variables, etc,
      \item JVM parameters
      \item Scheduling class
      \item Error-handling preferences: acceptable failure counts, timeouts, etc
      \item Debugging and monitoring requirements and preferences
    \end{itemize}
  
    \section{Operating System Limit Support}
    The CLI supports specification of operating system limits applied to the various job processes.
    To specify a limit, pass the name of the limit and its value in the {\em environment} specified
    in the job.  Limits are named with the string ``DUCC\_RLIMIT\_name'' where ``name'' is the name of
    a specific limit.  Supported limits include:
    \begin{itemize}
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_CORE    
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_CPU    
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_DATA   
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_FSIZE  
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_MEMLOCK
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_NOFILE 
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_NPROC  
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_RSS    
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_STACK  
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_AS        
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_LOCKS     
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_SIGPENDING
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_MSGQUEUE  
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_NICE      
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_STACK     
       \item DUCC\_RLIMIT\_RTPRIO   
    \end{itemize}
    See the Linux documentation for details on the meanings of these limits and their values.

    For example, to set the maximum number of open files allowed in any job process, specify 
    an environment similar to this when submitting the job:
\begin{verbatim}
     ducc_job_submit .... --environment="DUCC_RLIMT_NOFILE=1024" ...
\end{verbatim}
    
    \section{Command  Line Forms}
    The Command Line Interface is provided in several forms:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item A wrapper script around the uima-ducc-cli.jar.
      \item Direct invocation of each command's {\tt class} with the {\tt java} command.
    \end{enumerate}

    When using the scripts the full execution environment is established
    silently.  When invoking a command's {\tt class} directly, the java {\tt CLASSPATH}
    must include the uima-ducc-cli.jar, as illustrated in the wrapper scripts.

    \section{DUCC Commands}
    The following commands are provided:
    \begin{description}
    \item[ducc\_submit] Submit a job for execution.
    \item[ducc\_cancel] Cancel a job in progress.
    \item[ducc\_reserve] Request a reservation of full or partial machines.
    \item[ducc\_unreserve] Cancel a reservation.
    \item[ducc\_monitor] Monitor the progress of a job that is already submitted.
    \item[ducc\_process\_submit] Submit an arbitrary process (managed reservation) for execution.
    \item[ducc\_process\_cancel] Cancel an arbitrary process.
    \item[ducc\_services] Register, unregister, start, stop, modify, and query a service.
    \item[ducc\_view\_perf] Fetch performance data from the log and history files for analysis
      by spreadsheets, etc.
    \item[viaducc] This is a script wrapper to facilitate execution of Eclipse workspaces as
      DUCC jobs as well as general execution of arbitrary processes in DUCC-managed resources.
    \end{description}
    
    The next section describes these commands in detail.
