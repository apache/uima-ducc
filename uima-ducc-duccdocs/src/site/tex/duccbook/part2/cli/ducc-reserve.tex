    \section{ducc\_reserve}

    \paragraph{Description:}
    The reserve CLI is used request a reservation of resources. Reservations can be for entire 
    machines or partial machines, based on memory requirements. All reservations are persistent: 
    the resources remain dedicated to the requestor until explicitly returned. All reservations are 
    performeed on an "all-or-nothing" basis: either the entire set of requested resources is reserved, 
    or the reservation request fails. 

    All forms of ducc\_reserve block until the reservation is complete (or fails) at which point the DUCC
    ID of the reservation and the names of the reserved nodes are printed to the console and the
    command returns.

    \paragraph{Usage:}
        \begin{description}
        \item[Script wrapper] \ducchome/bin/ducc\_reserve {\em options}
        \item[Java Main]      java -cp \ducchome/lib/uima-ducc-cli.jar org.apache.uima.ducc.cli.DuccReservationSubmit {\em options}
        \end{description}

    \paragraph{Options:}
    
        \begin{description}

            \item[$--$debug ]          
              Prints internal debugging information, intended for DUCC developers or extended problem determination.
              
            \item[$--$description {[text]}]               
              The text is any string used to describe the reservation. It is displayed in the Web Server. 
              
            \item[$--$help ]             
              Prints the usage text to the console. 
                            
            \item[$--$_memory\_size {[integer]}]               
              This specifies the amount of memory the reserved machine must support. After rounding
              up it must match the total usable memory on the machine. (Required)

            \item[$--$scheduling\_class {[classname]}]               
              This specifies the name of the scheduling class the RM will use to determine the resource 
              allocation for each process. It must be one implementing the RESERVE policy.
              If not specified, the RESERVE default is taken from the site class definitions file
              described \hyperref[subsubsec:class.configuration]{here.} 
              
            \item[$-$f, $--$specification {[file]}]               
              All the parameters used to request a reservation may be placed in a standard Java 
              properties file. This file may then be used to submit the request (rather than providing all 
              the parameters directory to submit). 

        \end{description}
            
    \paragraph{Notes:}
    Reservations must be for full machines, in a job class implementing the RESERVE scheduling
    policy. The default DUCC distribution configures class {\em reserve} for full machine
    reservations.
