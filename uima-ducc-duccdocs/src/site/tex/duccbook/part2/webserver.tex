\chapter{DUCC Web Server}

    The {\DUCC} Web Server default address is accessed from the URL http://[DUCC-HOST]:42133.  The
    {\em[DUCC-HOST]} is the hostname where the local installation has installed the {\DUCC}
    Web Server.
    
  \begin{center}     
  \cfbox{green}{The hostname and port are configurable by
  the {\DUCC} administrator in ducc.properties}
  \end{center}
  
    The Webserver is designed to be mostly self-documenting. The design is intentionally simple 
    and contains a link to this document.  Most of the interesting fields and column headers
    have ``mouse hovers'' which display a short 
    description if you hover your mouse pointer over it for a moment.

\end{figure}

    Normally, the Web Server automatically fetches new data from {\DUCC} and updates the display.
    This is controlled by setting one of the two refresh modes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Manual refresh.  In this mode, the browser windows are updated only by using the
        browser's refresh button, or the {\DUCC} refresh button to the left in the header of
        each page.
      \item Automatic refresh. In this mode, the browser automatically fetches and displays
        new data.  The rate of refresh is currently fixed and cannot be configured.
    \end{itemize}
    
    There is a behavior difference between refresh and reload.
    \paragraph{Refresh}
    Refresh causes the current data on the page to be updated with the most
    current information in the Webserver's possession.  This is performed
    when the refresh button is clicked.
    \paragraph{Reload}
    Reload occurs when the enter key is pressed.  Reload causes not just the
    data to be updated but rather the entire page is replaced.
    
    Two different table styles are supported:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Scroll, and
      \item Classic.
    \end{itemize}
    Table styles are switched using the {\em Preferences} link.

    \paragraph{Scroll Mode}  When {\em scroll table style} is the preference, a scroll bar is
    shown to the right, within the main window.  The scroll bar allows scrolling to be restricted to the data
    display, leaving column and {\DUCC} headers in place.  In this mode any column may be sorted
    simply by clicking on it.
    
    With respect to sorting, any specified sort is remembered for refresh
    but forgotten for reload.  Sorting is permitted when either manual
    or automatic refresh mode is selected.
    
    The column sort order is maintained until the page is reloaded.

	Note that not all pages have a scroll version - some only have a classic version.
	
    \paragraph{Classic Mode}  When {\em classic table style} is the preference, the
    main data may extend below the bottom of the page and it will be necessary to use the browser's scroller on the right
    to access it.  The column headers and {\DUCC} header scrolls off when doing this.  Columns
    may be sorted in this mode but it is necessary to first switch to ``Manual'' refresh mode to
    prevent browser refreshes during sorting and display of data. 
    
    With respect to sorting, any specified sort is forgotten for refresh
    and reload.  Sorting is only permitted when manual refresh mode is
    selected.
    
    The column sort order is maintained until the page is refreshed or reloaded.

    \section{Common Links}

        Every page contains a common header containing links and controls. The links permit navigation
        to other content at the site. The controls provide page-wise configuration of the content at
        that page.

        The following links are available on every page of the web server: 

        \begin{description}
          \item[Authentication] \hfill \\ 
            Authentication is needed in order to cancel jobs and reservations, to create a
            reservation, and to perform administration. It is not required to simply view the pages.

            \begin{itemize}
              \item Login - Authenticate and start a session with the Web Server.             
              \item Logout - Terminate the Web Server session 
            \end{itemize}

          \item[Preferences]
            The following preferences may be set:
            \begin{description}
              \item[Table Style] This selects ``scroll'' or ``classic'' display, as
                described above.
              \item[Date Style] This selects long, medium, or long formats for dates.
              \item[Description Style] This selects long or short formats for the various
                description fields.
              \item[Display Style] Choose to display text or (in some circumstances) icons.
              \item[Filter Users] This controls the ``filter'' box near the middle of
                the header on each page.  It allows various levels of inclusion and
                exclusion of active or completed work for the filtered users.
              \item[Role] This allows selection of ``User'' or ``Administrator'' roles.
                This protects registered {\DUCC} administrators from accidentally affecting
                other people's work.
            \end{description}
            
          \item[DuccBook] \hfill \\
            This is a link to the HTML version of the document you are reading.

          \item[Jobs] \hfill \\
            This navigates to the Jobs page, showing all the jobs in the system.

          \item[Reservations] \hfill \\
            This navigates to the Reservations page, showing all the reservations
            in the system and provides a button that can be used to request new reservations. 

          \item[Services] \hfill \\
            This navigates to the Services page, showing all the services in the
            system.

          \item[System] \hfill \\
            This opens a sub-menu with system-related links:
            \begin{itemize}
              \item Administration - This opens a page with administrative functions. 
              \item Broker - This shows information about the AMQ broker employed by the system. 
              \item Classes - This shows all the scheduling classes defined to the system. 
              \item Daemons - This shows the status of {\DUCC}'s management processes. 
              \item DuccBook - This manual. 
              \item Machines - This shows the status of all the {\DUCC} worker nodes. 
            \end{itemize}

            \item[Viz]
            This opens a page with a visualization of the system hosts, showing all
            scheduled work in the system.
      \end{description}
