\section{Multiple DUCC head nodes}

This first major section describes support for multiple active DUCC head nodes.

\subsection{Introduction}
    DUCC can be configured to run reliably by having multiple head nodes,
    comprising one {\em master} and one or more {\em backup} head nodes.
    DUCC exploits Linux {\em keepalived} virtual IP addressing to enable
    this capability.
    
    The advantages are that if the {\em master} DUCC host becomes
    unusable, the {\em backup} DUCC can take over seamlessly
    such that active distributed Jobs, Reservations, Managed Reservations 
    and Services continue uninterrupted.  Take over also facilitates
    continued acceptance of new submissions and monitoring of new and
    existing submissions without interruption.

\subsection{Daemons}
   Each head node, whether {\em master} or {\em backup}, runs a Broker,
   Orchestrator, PM, RM, and SM.
   
   The Cassandra database is expected to be located on a node(s) separate from the head nodes.
   
   Likewise, the JD node(s) is separate from the head nodes.
   
   The Agents are distributed, as before.
        
\subsection{Configuring Host Machines}    
    See {\em Configuring Simple Virtual IP Address Failover Using Keepalived} 
    which can be found at this web address: 
    \url{https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E41138/html/section_uxg_lzh_nr.html}.

	Sample MASTER /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
	
	\begin{verbatim}
    ! Configuration File for keepalived

	vrrp_instance VI_1 {
	    state MASTER
	    interface eth0
	    virtual_router_id 51
	    priority 100
	    advert_int 1
	    authentication {
	        auth_type PASS
	        auth_pass 1111
	    }
	    virtual_ipaddress {
	        192.168.6.253
	    }
	}
   	\end{verbatim}

	Sample BACKUP /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
	
	\begin{verbatim}
    ! Configuration File for keepalived

	vrrp_instance VI_1 {
	    state BACKUP
	    interface eth0
	    virtual_router_id 51
	    priority 100
	    advert_int 1
	    authentication {
	        auth_type PASS
	        auth_pass 1111
	    }
	    virtual_ipaddress {
	        192.168.6.253
	    }
	}
   	\end{verbatim}

	Linux Commands
	
	Starting keepalived
	
    \begin{verbatim}
    > sudo service keepalived start
    Starting keepalived:                                       [  OK  ]
   	\end{verbatim}
   	
   	Querying keepalived
	
    \begin{verbatim}
    > /sbin/ip addr show dev eth0
	2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP qlen 1000
	    link/ether 00:21:5e:20:02:84 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
	    inet 192.168.3.7/16 brd 192.168.255.255 scope global eth0
	    inet 192.168.6.253/32 scope global eth0
	    inet6 fe80::221:5eff:fe20:284/64 scope link 
	       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   	\end{verbatim}

	Stopping keepalived
	
    \begin{verbatim}
    > sudo service keepalived stop
    Stopping keepalived: 
   	\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Configuring DUCC}  
    To configure DUCC to run reliable, one required property must
    be configured in the {\em site.ducc.properties} file.  Example:
    
    \begin{verbatim}
	ducc.head = 192.168.6.253
   	\end{verbatim}
    
    Use the virtual IP address configured for your host machines keepalived. 
    
\subsection{Webserver}

	Webserver for Master

	The {\em master} DUCC Webserver will display all pages normally with additional
	information in the heading upper left:
	
	reliable: \textbf{master}
	
	Webserver for Backup
	
	The {\em backup} DUCC Webserver will display some pages normally with additional
	information in the heading upper left:
	
	\underline{reliable}: \textbf{backup}
   	
   	Hovering over \underline{reliable} will yield the following information:
   	{\em Click to visit master}
   	
   	Several pages will display the following information (or similar):
   	
   	\begin{verbatim}
	no data - not master
   	\end{verbatim}
	
\subsection{Code changes}

The key changes include a new script (see ducc\_head\_mode.py) to 
interact with Linux to determine virtual IP address status and 
corresponding Java code (see common.head.ADuccHead.java)
that interprets the status to make transitions between 
{\em master} and {\em backup} states.

\subsubsection{new scripts}

\textbf{ducc\_head\_mode.py}

This is a new script employed at runtime by the various daemons to
determine the current mode of operation.  Status is determined 
though invocation of this script upon receipt of each Orchestrator
publication.

   \begin{verbatim}
    # purpose:    determine reliable ducc status
    # input:      none
    # output:     one of { unspecified, master, backup }
    # operation:  look in ducc.properties for relevant keywords
    #             and employ linux commands to determine if system
    #             has matching configured virtual IP address
   \end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{existing scripts}

{\renewcommand\labelitemi{}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{ducc\_post\_install} - no need to create webserver request log directory
  \item \textbf{ducc\_util.py} - incorporate host name into cassandra.pid, cassandra.console path; broker host must be local host; head node must be eligible with respect to keepalived.conf; head node local components are all daemons except Database and Agents
  \item \textbf{ducc.py} - incorporate host name into cassandra.pid, cassandra.console path
  \item \textbf{start\_ducc.py} - head node local components must start on eligible local host
\end{itemize}
}

\subsubsection{configuration files}

\textbf{ducc.properties}  

   \begin{verbatim}
    # The name of the node where DUCC runs.
    # This property declares the node where the DUCC administrative processes run (Orchestrator,
    # Resource Manager, Process Manager, Service Manager).  This property is required and MUST be
    # configured in new installation.  The installation script ducc_post_install initializes this 
    # property to the node the script is executed on.
    # Reliable DUCC: if running reliably, then this value must be the same as that specified
    # for the virtual_ipaddress in /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf.  DUCC CLI and Agents employ
    # this value to connect to the current reliable DUCC head node.
    ducc.head = <head-node>
   \end{verbatim}

Although not strictly true, the Orchestrator, RM, SM, PM, Webserver and Broker "must"
all be configured on the head node.  Reliable DUCC may work with other configurations,
but it has not been tested as such.

\textbf{log4j.xml}

   \begin{verbatim}
    Add DUCC\_NODENAME to log file name for OR, RM, PM, SM, and system-events.
    This allows reliable DUCC head nodes to share the same ducc\_runtime directory
    in the filesystem without collisions.
