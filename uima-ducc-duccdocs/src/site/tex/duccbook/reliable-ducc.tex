\section{Multiple DUCC head nodes}

This first major section describes support for multiple active DUCC head nodes.

\subsection{Introduction}
    DUCC can be configured to run reliably by having multiple head nodes,
    comprising one {\em master} and one or more {\em backup} head nodes.
    DUCC exploits Linux {\em keepalived} virtual IP addressing to enable
    this capability.
    
    The advantages are that if the {\em master} DUCC host becomes
    unusable, the {\em backup} DUCC can take over seamlessly
    such that active distributed Jobs, Reservations, Managed Reservations 
    and Services continue uninterrupted.  Take over also facilitates
    continued acceptance of new submissions and monitoring of new and
    existing submissions without interruption.

\subsection{Daemons}
   Each head node, whether {\em master} or {\em backup}, runs a Broker,
   Orchestrator, PM, RM, and SM.
   
   The Cassandra database is expected to be located on a node(s) separate from the head nodes.
   
   Likewise, the JD node(s) is separate from the head nodes.
   
   The Agents are distributed, as before.
        
\subsection{Configuring Host Machines}    
    See {\em Configuring Simple Virtual IP Address Failover Using Keepalived} 
    which can be found at this web address: 
    \url{https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E41138/html/section_uxg_lzh_nr.html}.

	Linux Commands
	
	Starting keepalived
	
    \begin{verbatim}
    > sudo service keepalived start
    Starting keepalived:                                       [  OK  ]
   	\end{verbatim}
   	
   	Querying keepalived
	
    \begin{verbatim}
    > ip addr show dev eth0
    2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:21:5e:20:02:84 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.3.7/16 brd 192.168.255.255 scope global eth0
    inet 192.168.200.17/32 scope global eth0
    inet6 fe80::221:5eff:fe20:284/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   	\end{verbatim}

	Stopping keepalived
	
    \begin{verbatim}
    > sudo service keepalived stop
    Stopping keepalived: 
   	\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Configuring DUCC}  
    To configure DUCC to run reliable, there are two properties that must
    be configured in the {\em site.ducc.properties} file.  Example:
    
    \begin{verbatim}
	ducc.virtual.ip.device = eth0
	ducc.virtual.ip.address = 192.168.200.17
   	\end{verbatim}
    
    Use the device and virtual IP address configured for your host machines. 
    
\subsection{Webserver}

	Webserver for Master

	The {\em master} DUCC Webserver will display all pages normally with additional
	information in the heading upper left:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	reliable: \textbf{master}
   	\end{verbatim}
	
	Webserver for Backup
	
	The {\em backup} DUCC Webserver will display some pages normally with additional
	information in the heading upper left:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	\underline{reliable}: \textbf{backup}
   	\end{verbatim}
   	
   	Hovering over \underline{reliable} will yield the following information:
   	{\em Click to visit master}
   	
   	Several pages will display the following information (or similar):
   	
   	\begin{verbatim}
	no data - not master
   	\end{verbatim}
	
\subsection{Code changes}

The key changes include a new script (see ducc\_head\_mode.py) to 
interact with Linux to determine virtual IP address status and 
corresponding Java code (see common.head.ADuccHead.java)
that interprets the status to make transitions between 
{\em master} and {\em backup} states.

\subsubsection{scripts and configuration files}

\textbf{ducc\_head\_mode.py}

This is a new script employed at runtime by the various daemons to
determine the current mode of operation.  Status is determined 
though invocation of this script upon receipt of each Orchestrator
publication.

   \begin{verbatim}
    # purpose:    determine reliable ducc status
    # input:      none
    # output:     one of { unspecified, master, backup }
    # operation:  look in ducc.properties for relevant keywords
    #             and employ linux commands to determine if system
    #             has matching configured virtual ip address
   \end{verbatim}
    
\textbf{ducc.properties}  

   \begin{verbatim}
    # These optional properties declare virtual ip device and address for "reliable" DUCC.
    # Reliable DUCC comprises a MASTER and BACKUP configured using Linux keepalived, which
    # must correspond with the below two DUCC properties.
    # The following signify "reliable" DUCC is *not* in effect:
    # - omission of one or both of these properties
    # - 0.0.0.0 specified as <ducc.virtual.ip.address>
    # When in effect, a DUCC head node will act as MASTER only when the command
    # > ip addr show dev <ducc.virtual.ip.device> displays <ducc.virtual.ip.address>
    # Automatic takeover by the DUCC head BACKUP from DUCC head MASTER (and vice versa) occurs 
    # when the above command results change.
    ducc.virtual.ip.device = eth0
    ducc.virtual.ip.address = 0.0.0.0
   \end{verbatim}
